# -- Format example --
# A section can have either a "flat" layout where all of the content
# appears in a single panel, or it can have multiple panels navigated
# via a side navigation.
#
# To achieve the "flat" layout, the section should include primary_links
# and secondary_links at the top level, and to use the side navigation view
# the section should only include side_nav_sections at the top level, using
# the formats below.
