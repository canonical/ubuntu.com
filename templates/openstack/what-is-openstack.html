      <h1>What is OpenStack?</h1>
      <p>
        OpenStack is an open-source cloud platform that manages distributed compute, network and storage resources, aggregates them into pools, and allows on-demand provisioning of virtual resources through a self-service portal.
      </p>
      <p>OpenStack is a cost-effective extension of the existing public cloud infrastructure and a reasonable alternative to proprietary virtualisation solutions. It enables organisations to optimise their cloud costs and service providers to build an infrastructure competitive to hyperscalers.</p>

      <h2>OpenStack ensures TCO reduction</h2>
      <p>
        Since more and more organisations are using <a href="/cloud/hybrid-cloud">hybrid</a> <a href="/cloud/multi-cloud">multi-cloud architecture</a>, implementing an own
        cloud is a natural step once the number of workloads grows. Although
        CapEx costs associated with an initial deployment of OpenStack
        are high, its OpEx costs are significantly lower compared to hyperscalers.
        As a result, the aggregated total cost of ownership (TCO) is lower when running workloads in the long term
        and at scale. This allows businesses to optimise their cloud maintenance
        costs and service providers to build an infrastructure competitive to hyperscalers.

      <h2>OpenStack is more than virtualisation</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike traditional virtualisation management platforms, such as VMware
        vSphere or Red Hat Virtualization Manager, OpenStack is a fully
        functional cloud platform as defined by the
        <a

          href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/nist-cloud-computing-program-nccp"
          >National Institute of Standards and Technology</a
        >. This means that OpenStack basically resembles the behaviour of public
        clouds. Users can request compute, network and storage resources
        on-demand through a self-service portal. Although they are provided in
        the form of virtual machines, virtual networks and virtual disks, exactly
        as in the traditional virtualisation management platforms, they are
        defined through the APIs. For businesses, the ability to define
        virtualised resources programmatically enables fast-paced infrastructure
        automation and cloud-style operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there are more differences between OpenStack and traditional
        virtualisation management platforms. Refer to the following table for

      <h2>How does OpenStack work?</h2>
      <p>
        OpenStack is an open-source cloud platform designed to manage
        distributed compute, network and storage resources in the data centre.
        In principle, OpenStack agregates physical resources into one big pool
        and allocates virtual resources out of this pool to users who can
        request them on-demand through a self-service portal or application
        programming interfaces (APIs). But OpenStack itself does not handle
        virtualisation. Instead, it leverages the existing virtualisation
        technologies. Therefore, OpenStack is more like a wrapper around
        traditional virtualisation tools, enabling cloud-native capabilities.

        OpenStack is based on a modular architecture. There are six primary
        OpenStack components that handle compute, network and storage functions
        for on-demand VM provisioning. A bunch of other components enable
        additional features, such as dashboarding, bare metal provisioning,
        containers, secrets management and telemetry. In order to handle this
        complexity, organisations often use
