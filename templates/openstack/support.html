      <h2>For mission-critical infrastructure</h2>

      <p>OpenStack is 100% open source and benefits from community support and collaboration. However, when it comes to implementing a mission-critical infrastructure, this alone may not be sufficient.</p>

      <p>Here are some common challenges organisations usually face when using OpenStack in production:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>There is no experience inside of the operations team to troubleshoot incidents and problems in a timely manner.</li>
        <li>There is no knowledge inside of the operations team to patch the code in case of any software bugs.</li>
        <li>The cloud has to receive security updates for a longer period of time.</li>
        <li>The cloud has to meet local compliance regulations.</li>
        <li>The cloud has to be operated with minimal downtime.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Canonical addresses all those challenges, providing enterprise OpenStack support subscription for OpenStack clouds deployed on Ubuntu.</p>
