      <h2>The enterprise storage challenge</h2>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-8">
      <p>The rate of enterprise data creation growth is exponential. As structured and unstructured data fills disks, compliance burdens increase, and data retention policies lengthen, every organisation must find cost-effective ways to grow their storage capabilities.</p>
      <p>Public clouds have pioneered the approach of network-hosted software-defined storage architectures, delivering very reliable and efficient storage at low cost. Traditional enterprise SAN (Storage Area Network) and NAS (Network Attached Storage) solutions are now considered expensive to purchase, expand and upgrade.</p>
      <p>The data center is following, and software-defined storage based on commodity servers and disks with Ubuntu has become the new norm for high-growth low-cost block storage, object stores and data lakes. Open source Ceph, Swift and HDFS enable massive enterprise operations with total costs in line with the underlying bulk commodity disk prices.</p>
      <p>Ubuntu Advantage Storage is the proven enterprise software-defined storage offering at the lowest per gigabyte price.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row u-equal-height">
    <div class="col-7">
      <p>Legacy storage solutions are often priced per-node or according to total disk capacity. This can lead to a penalty for good practices such as high durability&nbsp;replication.</p>
      <p>Ubuntu Advantage Storage is different. Our pricing is based on the amount of data you record in your storage pool, regardless of how it is written or how much disk space is used.</p>
      <p>Ubuntu Advantage Storage means you don&rsquo;t have to pay for replicas or empty space.</p>
