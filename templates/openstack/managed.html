    <h2>Why managed private cloud?</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-8">
      <p>While public clouds provide immediate access to the infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) offering, they are not economical in the long term and at scale. At the same time, implementing a private cloud comes with a cost.</p>
      <p>
        What if:
        <ul>
          <li>Your public cloud costs are growing with a trajectory you cannot afford?</li>
          <li>You have no knowledge and experience to deploy and operate a cost-effective private cloud yourself?</li>
          <li>You do not have enough resources to provide 24x7 coverage for the platform hosting your business apps?</li>
          <li>You need a quick time-to-market and have no time to hire and train a dedicated operations team?</li>
          <li>You have no facilities to host a private cloud?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Canonical's Managed OpenStack solves all those challenges, providing the fastest and the most cost-effective path to an OpenStack private cloud.</p>
