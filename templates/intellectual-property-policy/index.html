		<h1>Intellectual property rights policy</h1>
		<p><strong>What&rsquo;s new?</strong> On 14th May 2013 we updated our trademark policy and renamed it the &ldquo;intellectual property rights policy&rdquo;.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Why?</strong> We want to ensure that anyone using Canonical&rsquo;s intellectual property does so in compliance with Canonical&rsquo;s rights. As such, we have redrafted the existing policy to more clearly identify what intellectual property rights Canonical has and to clarify and simplify the language. In particular, we have clarified Canonical&rsquo;s position with respect to the redistribution of Ubuntu.</p>
		
		<p><strong>What&rsquo;s changed?</strong> Essentially nothing. We&rsquo;re just making things clearer.</p>
		
		<p>Please read the updated intellectual property rights policy to find out more.</p>
		
		<p>Welcome to Canonical&rsquo;s IPRights Policy. This policy is published by Canonical Limited (Canonical, we, us and our) under the Creative Commons CC-BY-SA version 3.0 UK licence. </p>
		
		<p>Canonical owns and manages certain intellectual property rights in Ubuntu and other associated intellectual property (Canonical IP) and licenses the use of these rights to enterprises, individuals and members of the Ubuntu community in accordance with this IPRights Policy.</p>
		
		<p>Your use of Canonical IP is subject to:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Your acceptance of this IPRights Policy;</li>
			<li>Your acknowledgement that Canonical IP is the exclusive property of Canonical and can only be used with Canonical&rsquo;s permission (which can be revoked at any time); and</li>
			<li>You taking all reasonable steps to ensure that Canonical IP is used in a manner that does not affect either the validity of such Canonical IP or Canonical&rsquo;s ownership of  Canonical IP in any way; and that you will transfer any goodwill you derive from them to Canonical, if requested.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Ubuntu is a trusted open source platform. To maintain that trust we need to manage the use of Ubuntu and the components within it very carefully. This way, when people use Ubuntu, or anything bearing the Ubuntu brand, they can be assured that it will meet the standards they expect.  Your continued use of Canonical IP implies your acceptance and acknowledgement of this IPRights Policy. </p>
		
		<h3>1. Summary</h3>
		
		<ul>

			<li>You can modify Ubuntu for personal or internal commercial use. </li>

		<h3>2. Your use of Ubuntu</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>You can download, install and receive updates to Ubuntu for free.</strong>
				<p>Ubuntu is freely available to all users for personal, or in the case of organisations, internal use. It is provided for this use without warranty. All implied warranties are disclaimed to the fullest extent permitted at law.</p>
			</li>
			<li><string>You can modify Ubuntu for personal or internal use.</string>
				<p>You can make changes to Ubuntu for your own personal use or for your organisation&rsquo;s own internal use.</p>
			</li>
			<li><strong>You can redistribute Ubuntu, but only where there has been no modification to it. </strong>
				<p>You can redistribute Ubuntu in its unmodified form, complete with the installer images and packages provided by Canonical (this includes the publication or launch of virtual machine images). </p>
				<p>Any redistribution of modified versions of Ubuntu must be approved, certified or provided by Canonical if you are going to associate it with the Trademarks. Otherwise you must remove and replace the Trademarks and will need to recompile the source code to create your own binaries. This does not affect your rights under any open source licence applicable to any of the components of Ubuntu. If you need us to approve, certify or provide modified versions for redistribution you will require a licence agreement from Canonical, for which you may be required to pay. For further information, please contact us (as set out below). </p>
				<p>We do not recommend using modified versions of Ubuntu which are not modified in accordance with this IPRights Policy. Modified versions may be corrupted and users of such modified systems or images may find them to be inconsistent with the updates published by Canonical to its users. If they use the Trademarks, they are in contravention of this IPRights Policy. Canonical cannot guarantee the performance of such modified versions. Canonical&rsquo;s updates will be consistent with every version of Ubuntu approved, certified or provided by Canonical.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>5. Logo use guidelines</h3>

		<h3>6. Use of Canonical IP by the Ubuntu community</h3>
		<p>Ubuntu is built by Canonical and the Ubuntu community. We share access rights owned by Canonical with the Ubuntu community for the purposes of discussion, development and advocacy.
