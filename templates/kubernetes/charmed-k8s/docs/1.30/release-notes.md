# 1.30

### July 11, 2024 - `charmed-kubernetes --channel 1.30/stable`

The release bundle can also be [downloaded here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charmed-kubernetes/bundle/main/releases/1.30/bundle.yaml).

## What's new

### Integration gaps
- Cloud Integrations
  - Direct integration between `[aws|azure|gcp]-integrator` charms and
    `kubernetes-control-plane` are back in this release for tagging machines
    and requesting cloud permissions for those machines.

    The recommended method for enabling native cloud features is
    to use the respective out-of-tree cloud provider charms.
    See the cloud-specific documentation for details.

- Charm actions for some administrative tasks have been restored.
  - `apply-manifest`
  - `namespace-create`
  - `namespace-delete`
  - `namespace-list`
  - `restart`
  - `user-create`
  - `user-delete`
  - `user-list`

- Cilium Charm
  - The charm now provide manifest deployment versions `1.13` and `1.14` which
    helps address sig-network tests failing in CIS compliance.
