It is recommended that you keep your **Kubernetes** deployment updated to the latest available stable version. You should also update the other applications which make up the **Charmed Kubernetes**. Keeping up to date ensures you have the latest bug-fixes and security patches for smooth operation of your cluster.

You can check the latest release version on the [Kubernetes release page on GitHub][k8s-release]. **Charmed Kubernetes** is kept in close sync with upstream Kubernetes: updated versions will be released within a week of a new upstream version of **Kubernetes**.

<div class="p-notification--information is-inline">
  <div markdown="1" class="p-notification__content">
    <span class="p-notification__title">Note:</span>
    <p class="p-notification__message"><strong>Kubernetes</strong> will automatically handle patch releases. This means that the cluster will perform an unattended automatic upgrade between patch versions, e.g. 1.24.1 to 1.24.2. Attended upgrades are only required when you wish to upgrade a minor version, e.g. 1.22.x to 1.23.x.</p>
  </div>
</div>

You can see which version of each application is currently deployed by running

```bash
juju status
```

The 'App' section of the output lists each application and its version number. Note that this is the version of the upstream application deployed. The version of the Juju charm is indicated under the column titled 'Rev'. The charms may be updated in between new versions of the application.

## Before you begin

<div class="p-notification--caution is-inline">
  <div markdown="1" class="p-notification__content">
    <span class="p-notification__title">Warning!:</span>
    <p class="p-notification__message"><strong>Juju compatibility</strong>  The latest current version of Juju (as of the time of the Charmed Kubernetes 1.27 release) is <strong>3.1</strong>. This new major release introduces some breaking changes with previous versions. It is recommended that you upgrade to this new version of Juju, but also be aware of the changes. See the <a href="https://juju.is/docs/juju/upgrade-your-juju-deployment-from-2-9-to-3-x"> Juju documentation</a> for more information.</p>
  </div>
</div>



As with all upgrades, there is a possibility that there may be unforeseen difficulties. It is **highly recommended that you make a backup** of any important data, including any running workloads. For more details on creating backups, see the separate [documentation on backups][backups].

You should also make sure:

-   The machine from which you will perform the backup has sufficient internet access to retrieve updated software.
-   Your cluster is running normally.
-   Your Juju client and controller/models are running the same, stable version of Juju (see the [Juju docs][juju-controller-upgrade]).
-   You read the [Upgrade notes][notes] to see if any caveats apply to the versions you are upgrading to/from.
-   You read the [Release notes][release-notes] for the version you are upgrading to, which will alert you to any important changes to the operation of your cluster.
-   You read the [Upstream release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.27.md#deprecation) for details of deprecation notices and API changes for Kubernetes 1.27 which may impact your workloads.

It is also important to understand that **Charmed Kubernetes** will only upgrade
and if necessary migrate, components relating specifically to elements of
Kubernetes installed and configured as part of Charmed Kubernetes.
This may not include any customised configuration of Kubernetes, or user
generated objects (e.g. storage classes) or deployments which rely on
deprecated APIs.

<div class="p-notification--information is-inline">
  <div markdown="1" class="p-notification__content">
    <span class="p-notification__title">Note:</span>
    <p class="p-notification__message"><strong>The 'bionic' series (Ubuntu 18.04) is no longer supported:</strong> Support for bionic series charms in relation to Charmed Kubernetes has expired. If you are running charms on 'bionic', you will need to series upgrade the charms before completing the rest of the upgrade procedure.</p>
  </div>
</div>


## Upgrading the Machine's Series (required for machines currently running 18.04(Bionic))

All of the charms support [upgrading the machine's series via Juju](https://juju.is/docs/juju/manage-machines#heading--upgrade-a-machine).
As each machine is upgraded, the applications on that machine will be stopped and the unit will
go into a `blocked` status until the upgrade is complete. For the worker units, pods will be drained
from the node and onto one of the other nodes at the start of the upgrade, and the node will be removed
from the pool until the upgrade is complete.


## Infrastructure updates

The applications which run alongside the core Kubernetes components can be upgraded
at any time. These applications are widely used and may frequently receive upgrades
outside of the cycle of new releases of Kubernetes.

This includes:

- easyrsa
- etcd
- flannel, calico or other CNI

Note that this may include other applications which you may have installed, such as
Elasticsearch, Prometheus, Nagios, Helm, etc.


<a id='upgrading-containerd'> </a>

### Upgrading Containerd

By default, Versions 1.15 and later use Containerd as the container
runtime. This subordinate charm can be upgraded with the command:

```bash
juju refresh containerd --channel=1.27/stable
```

### Upgrading etcd

As **etcd** manages critical data for the cluster, it is advisable to create a snapshot of
this data before running an upgrade. This is covered in more detail in the
[documentation on backups][backups] (including how to restore snapshots in case of
problems).

Upgrade the charm with the command:

```bash
juju refresh etcd --channel=1.27/stable
```

To upgrade **etcd** itself, you will need to set the **etcd** charm's channel
config.

To determine the correct channel, go to the
[releases section of the bundle repository][bundle-repo] page and check the relevant
**Charmed Kubernetes** bundle. Within the bundle, you should see which channel
the **etcd** charm is configured to use.

Once you know the correct channel, set the **etcd** charm's channel config:

```bash
juju config etcd channel=3.4/stable
```

### Upgrading additional components

The other infrastructure applications can be upgraded by running the `upgrade-charm`
command:

```bash
juju refresh easyrsa --channel=1.27/stable
```

Any other infrastructure charms should be upgraded in a similar way. For
example, if you are using the flannel CNI:

```bash
juju refresh flannel --channel=1.27/stable
```

<div class="p-notification--caution">
  <p markdown="1" class="p-notification__response">
    <span class="p-notification__status">Note:</span>
Some services may be briefly interrupted during the upgrade process. Upgrading
your CNI (e.g. flannel) will cause a small amount of network downtime. Upgrading
<strong>easyrsa</strong> will not cause any downtime. The behaviour of other
components you have added to your cluster may vary - check individual documentation
for these charms for more information on upgrades.
  </p>
</div>

## Upgrading Kubernetes

Before you upgrade the **Kubernetes** components, you should be aware of the exact
release you wish to upgrade to.

The **Kubernetes** charms use **snap** _channels_ to manage the version of
**Kubernetes** to use. Channels are explained in more detail in the
[official snap documentation][snap-channels], but in terms of **Kubernetes** all you
need to know are the major and minor version numbers and the 'risk-level':

| Risk level | Description                                               |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| stable     | The latest stable released version of Kubernetes          |
| candidate  | Release candidate versions of Kubernetes                  |
| beta       | Latest alpha/beta of Kubernetes for the specified release |
| edge       | Nightly builds of the specified release of Kubernetes     |

For most use cases, it is strongly recommended to use the 'stable' version of charms.

### Upgrading the **kube-api-loadbalancer**

A core part of **Charmed Kubernetes** is the kubeapi-load-balancer component. To ensure API service
continuity this upgrade should precede any upgrades to the **Kubernetes** master and
worker units.

```bash
juju refresh kubeapi-load-balancer --channel=1.27/stable
```

The load balancer itself is based on NGINX, and the version reported by `juju status` is
that of NGINX rather than Kubernetes. Unlike the other Kubernetes components, there
is no need to set a specific channel or version for this charm.

### Upgrading the **kubernetes-control-plane** units

**Note**: Older versions of Charmed-Kubernetes used `kubernetes-master` as the charm name. This has been updated
to `kubernetes-control-plane`. However, it is not possible to rename a deployed application. If you 
originally installed version 1.23 or before, your units will follow the old naming scheme and you should
substitute `kubernetes-control-plane`for `kubernetes-master`in the following commands.

To start upgrading the Kubernetes master units, first upgrade the charm:

```bash
juju refresh kubernetes-control-plane --channel=1.27/stable
```

Once the charm has been upgraded, it can be configured to select the desired **Kubernetes** channel, which takes the form `Major.Minor/risk-level`. This is then passed as a configuration option to the charm. So, for example, to select the stable 1.25 version of **Kubernetes**, you would enter:

```bash
juju config kubernetes-control-plane channel=1.27/stable
```

If you wanted to try a release candidate for 1.26, the channel would be `1.26/candidate`.

<div class="p-notification--caution">
  <p markdown="1" class="p-notification__response">
    <span class="p-notification__status">Note:</span>
Once the configuration has been changed, the charms will be put into a `blocked` state.
You must continue the upgrade process, even if you revert the configuration to the
currently active version of Kubernetes.
  </p>
</div>

Once the desired version has been configured, the upgrades should be performed. This is done by running the `upgrade` action on each master unit in the cluster:

```bash
juju run-action kubernetes-control-plane/0 upgrade
juju run-action kubernetes-control-plane/1 upgrade
```

If you have more `kubernetes-control-plane` units in your cluster, you should continue and run this process on every one of them.

You can check the progress of the upgrade by running:

```bash
juju status | grep kubernetes-control-plane
```

Ensure that all the control plane units have upgraded and are reporting normal status before continuing to upgrade the worker units.

### Upgrading the **kubernetes-worker** units

For a running cluster, there are two different ways to proceed:

- [Blue-green][blue-green] upgrade - This requires more resources, but should ensure a safe, zero-downtime transition of workloads to an updated cluster
- In-place upgrade - this simply upgrades the workers in situ, which may involve some service interruption but doesn't require extra resources

Both methods are outlined below. The blue-green method is recommended for production systems.

#### Blue-green upgrade

To begin, upgrade the kubernetes-worker charm itself:

```bash
juju refresh kubernetes-worker --channel=1.27/stable
```

Next, run the command to configure the workers for the version of Kubernetes you wish to run (as you did previously for the master units). For example:

```bash
juju config kubernetes-worker channel=1.27/stable
```

Now add additional units of the kubernetes-worker. You should add as many units as you are replacing. For example, to add three additional units:

```bash
juju add-unit kubernetes-worker -n 3
```

This will create new units to migrate the existing workload to. As you configured the version prior to adding the units, they will be using the newly-selected version of **Kubernetes**.

Now we can pause the existing workers, which will cause the workloads to migrate to the new units recently added. A worker unit is paused by running the corresponding action on that unit:

```bash
juju run-action kubernetes-worker/0 pause
juju run-action kubernetes-worker/1 pause
juju run-action kubernetes-worker/2 pause
...
```

Continue until all the 'old' units have been paused. You can check on the workload status by running the command:

```bash
kubectl get pod -o wide
```

Once the workloads are running on the new units, it is safe to remove the old units:

```bash
juju remove-unit kubernetes-worker/0
```

Removing these units from the model will also release the underlying machines/instances they were running on, so no further clean up is required.

<div class="p-notification--information">
  <p markdown="1" class="p-notification__response">
    <span class="p-notification__status">Note:</span>
A variation on this method is to add, pause, remove  and recycle units one at a time. This reduces the resource overhead to a single extra instance.
  </p>
</div>

#### In-place upgrade

To proceed with an in-place upgrade, first upgrade the charm itself:

```bash
juju refresh kubernetes-worker --channel=1.27/stable
```

Next, run the command to configure the workers for the version of **Kubernetes** you wish to run (as you did previously for the master units). For example:

```bash
juju config kubernetes-worker channel=1.12/stable
```

All the units can now be upgraded by running the `upgrade` action on each one:

```bash
juju run-action kubernetes-worker/0 upgrade
juju run-action kubernetes-worker/1 upgrade
...
```

<a id='verify-upgrade'> </a>

## Verify an Upgrade

Once an upgrade is complete and units settle, the output from:

```bash
juju status
```

... should indicate that all units are active and the correct version of **Kubernetes** is running.

It is recommended that you run a [cluster validation][validation] to ensure that the cluster is fully functional.
