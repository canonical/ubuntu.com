# 1.19

### September 30th, 2020 - charmed-kubernetes-519

Before upgrading, please read the [upgrade notes](/kubernetes/docs/upgrade-notes).

## What's new

- IPv6 support

This release of Charmed Kubernetes can now enable the alpha IPv6 dual-stack or
beta IPv6-only support in Kubernetes by using IPv6 CIDRs in addition to or
instead of IPv4 CIDRs in the Kubernetes Master charm's `service-cidr` and the
Calico charm's `cidr` charm config.

More information can be found in [Using IPv6 with Charmed Kubernetes][ipv6],
including limitations and known issues.

- CIS benchmark compliance

Charmed Kubernetes is now compliant with the Center for Internet Security (CIS)
benchmark for Kubernetes. Significant changes to the `kubernetes-master` and
`kubernetes-worker` charms have been made to achieve this. Find more information
about these changes, running the benchmark, and analyzing test results in the
[CIS compliance for Charmed Kubernetes][cis-benchmark] documentation.

- Authentication changes

File-based authentication is not compliant with the CIS benchmark. Charmed Kubernetes
now deploys a webhook authentication service that compares API requests to Kubernetes
secrets. If needed, any existing entries in previous authentication files
(`basic_auth.csv` and `known_tokens.csv`) are migrated to secrets during the
`kubernetes-master` charm upgrade.

More information about this new service can be found in the
[Authorisation and Authentication][authn] documentation.

- New Calico configuration options

The new `veth-mtu` setting allows fine tuning of the MTU setting for optimum
performance on the underlying network. See the
[Calico documentation][veth-mtu] for more details and recommendations, and
the [Calico charm docs][1.19-calico] for information on how to set this
configuration.

Calico and related charms (Canal, Tigera Secure EE) also have a new
`ignore-loose-rpf` configuration option. By default, for security, these charms check
that the kernel has strict reverse path forwarding set (`net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter`
set to `0` or `1`). In some circumstances you may need to set this to 2, in which case
you can now set `ignore-loose-rpf=true` to ignore the check.

- Ubuntu 20.04

The default operating system for deployed machines is now Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal). Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) and 16.04 (Xenial) are still supported.

- MetalLB Operator

MetalLB offers a software network load balancing implementation that allows for
LoadBalancing services in Kubernetes. This bundle has been made available
in the Charm Store to be deployed along Charmed Kubernetes, MicroK8s, or any Kubernetes
supported by Juju. This operator deploys upstream MetalLB in layer 2 mode. The BGP mode
of upstream MetalLB is not supported yet. For more information about deploying and
operating MetalLB, please see the [MetalLB documentation](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes/docs/metallb).

- SR-IOV CNI

A new SR-IOV CNI addon has been made available for Charmed Kubernetes. Using
SR-IOV CNI, it is now possible to take network interfaces that are SR-IOV
Virtual Functions and attach them directly to pods. For more information, see
the new [SR-IOV CNI documentation][cni-sriov].

For a full list of the changes introduced in Kubernetes 1.19, please see the
[upstream release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.19.md)

[https://launchpad.net/charmed-kubernetes/+milestone/1.19](https://launchpad.net/charmed-kubernetes/+milestone/1.19).

## Notes / Known Issues

- The `insecure-bind-address` and `insecure-port` options to `kube-apiserver` have
  been removed in this release. Using `juju run` with `kubectl` to interact with the
  cluster now requires an explicit `--kubeconfig <file>` option:

      ```bash
      juju run --unit kubernetes-master/0 'kubectl --kubeconfig /root/.kube/config get nodes'
      NAME              STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
      ip-172-31-10-19   Ready    <none>   71m   v1.19.0
      ```

- The webhook authentication service included in this release runs on port 5000 of each
  kubernetes-master unit. Ensure this port is available prior to upgrading.

- Additional known issues scheduled for the first 1.19 bugfix release can be found at [https://launchpad.net/charmed-kubernetes/+milestone/1.19+ck1](https://launchpad.net/charmed-kubernetes/+milestone/1.19+ck1)
