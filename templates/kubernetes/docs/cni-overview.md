Managing a network where containers can interoperate efficiently is very
important. Kubernetes has adopted the Container Network Interface(CNI)
specification for managing network resources on a cluster. This relatively
simple specification makes it easy for Kubernetes to interact with a wide range
of CNI-based software solutions.

With **Charmed Kubernetes**, these networking 'plug-ins' are deployed as
subordinate charms with each  node running as a `kubernetes-control-plane` or
`kubernetes-worker`, and ensure the smooth running of the cluster. It is
possible to choose one of several different CNI providers for **Charmed
Kubernetes**, which are listed below:

## Supported CNI options

The currently supported base CNI solutions for **Charmed Kubernetes** are:

 -   [Calico][calico]
 -   [Canal][canal]
 -   [Flannel][flannel]
 -   [Tigera Secure EE][tigera]

By default, **Charmed Kubernetes** will deploy the cluster using calico. To chose a different CNI provider, see the individual links above.

The following CNI addons are also available:
 -   [Multus][multus]
 -   [SR-IOV][sr-iov]

## Migrating to a different CNI solution

As networking is a fundamental part of the cluster, changing the network on a live cluster
is not straightforward. Currently it is recommended to create a new cluster with **Charmed Kubernetes**
using the desired option. When [federation][] becomes part of a future release of
Kubernetes, such a migration should be manageable with no downtime.
