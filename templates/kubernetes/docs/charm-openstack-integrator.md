This charm acts as a proxy to OpenStack and provides an [interface][] to provide
a set of credentials for a somewhat limited project user to the applications that
are related to this charm.

## Usage

When on OpenStack, this charm can be deployed, granted trust via Juju to access
OpenStack, and then related to an application that supports the [interface][].

For example, [Charmed Kubernetes][] has support for this, and can be deployed with the
following bundle overlay ([download it here][asset-openstack-overlay]):

```yaml
applications:
  openstack-integrator:
    charm: cs:~containers/openstack-integrator
    num_units: 1
    trust: true
relations:
  - ['openstack-integrator', 'kubernetes-master:openstack']
  - ['openstack-integrator', 'kubernetes-worker:openstack']
```

Using Juju 2.4 or later:

```
juju deploy cs:charmed-kubernetes --overlay ./k8s-openstack-overlay.yaml --trust
```

To deploy with earlier versions of Juju, you will need to provide the cloud
credentials via the `credentials`, charm config options.

# Resource Usage Note

By relating to this charm, other charms can directly allocate resources, such
as PersistentDisk volumes and Load Balancers, which could lead to cloud charges
and count against quotas.  Because these resources are not managed by Juju,
they will not be automatically deleted when the models or applications are
destroyed, nor will they show up in Juju's status or GUI.  It is therefore up
to the operator to manually delete these resources when they are no longer
needed, using the OpenStack console or API.

# Examples

Following are some examples using OpenStack integration with Charmed Kubernetes.

## Creating a pod with a PersistentDisk-backed volume

This script creates a busybox pod with a persistent volume claim backed by
OpenStack's PersistentDisk.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# create a persistent volume claim using the StorageClass which is
# automatically created by Charmed Kubernetes when it is related to
# the openstack-integrator
kubectl create -f - <<EOY
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: testclaim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 100Mi
  storageClassName: cdk-cinder
EOY

# create the busybox pod with a volume using that PVC:
kubectl create -f - <<EOY
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: busybox
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
    - image: busybox
      command:
        - sleep
        - "3600"
      imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      name: busybox
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/pv"
          name: testvolume
  restartPolicy: Always
  volumes:
    - name: testvolume
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: testclaim
EOY
```

## Creating a service with a OpenStack load-balancer

The following script starts the hello-world pod behind a OpenStack-backed load-balancer.

```bash
kubectl create deployment hello-world --image=gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0
kubectl scale deployment hello-world --replicas=5
kubectl expose deployment hello-world --type=LoadBalancer --name=hello --port=8080
watch kubectl get svc hello -o wide
```

### bs-version



<a id="bs-version-description"> </a>
**Description:**

Used to override automatic version detection for block storage usage.
Valid values are v1, v2, v3 and auto. When auto is specified automatic
detection will select the highest supported version exposed by the
underlying OpenStack cloud. If not set, will use the upstream default.

[Back to table](#table-bs-version)




### credentials



<a id="credentials-description"> </a>
**Description:**

The base64-encoded contents of a JSON file containing OpenStack credentials.

The credentials must contain the following keys: auth-url, region, username,
password, project-name, user-domain-name, and project-domain-name.

It could also contain a base64-encoded CA certificate in endpoint-tls-ca key value.

This can be used from bundles with 'include-base64://' (see
https://juju.is/docs/sdk/bundles),
or from the command-line with 'juju config openstack-integrator credentials="$(base64 /path/to/file)"'.

It is strongly recommended that you use 'juju trust' instead, if available.

[Back to table](#table-credentials)




### endpoint-tls-ca



<a id="endpoint-tls-ca-description"> </a>
**Description:**

A CA certificate that can be used to verify the target cloud API endpoints.
Use 'include-base64://' in a bundle to include a certificate. Otherwise,
pass a base64-encoded certificate (base64 of "-----BEGIN" to "-----END")
as a config option in a Juju CLI invocation.

### floating-network-id



<a id="floating-network-id-description"> </a>
**Description:**

If set, it will be passed to integrated workloads to indicate that
floating IPs should be created in the given network for load balancers
that those workloads manage. For example, this will determine whether and
where FIPs will be created by Kubernetes for LoadBalancer type services
in the cluster.

[Back to table](#table-floating-network-id)




### ignore-volume-az



<a id="ignore-volume-az-description"> </a>
**Description:**

Used to influence availability zone use when attaching Cinder volumes.
When Nova and Cinder have different availability zones, this should be
set to true. This is most commonly the case where there are many Nova
availability zones but only one Cinder availability zone. If not set,
will use the upstream default.

[Back to table](#table-ignore-volume-az)




### lb-method



<a id="lb-method-description"> </a>
**Description:**

Algorithm that will be used by load balancers, which must be one of:
ROUND_ROBIN, LEAST_CONNECTIONS, SOURCE_IP. This applies both to load
balancers managed by this charm for applications related via the
loadbalancer endpoint, as well as to load balancers managed by integrated
workloads, such as Kubernetes.

[Back to table](#table-lb-method)




### lb-subnet



<a id="lb-subnet-description"> </a>
**Description:**

Override the subnet (name or ID) in which this charm will create load
balancers for other charms related on the loadbalancer endpoint. If not
set, the subnet over which the requesting application is related will be
used.

[Back to table](#table-lb-subnet)




### manage-security-groups



<a id="manage-security-groups-description"> </a>
**Description:**

Whether or not each load balancer should have its own security group, or
if all load balancers should use the default security group for the
project.  This applies both to load balancers managed by this charm for
applications related via the loadbalancer endpoint, as well as to load
balancers managed by integrated workloads, such as Kubernetes.

[Back to table](#table-manage-security-groups)




### snapd_refresh



<a id="snapd_refresh-description"> </a>
**Description:**

How often snapd handles updates for installed snaps. The default (an empty string) is 4x per day. Set to "max" to check once per month based on the charm deployment date. You may also set a custom string as described in the 'refresh.timer' section here:
  https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/system-options/87

[Back to table](#table-snapd_refresh)




### subnet-id



<a id="subnet-id-description"> </a>
**Description:**

If set, it will be passed to integrated workloads to indicate in what
subnet load balancers should be created. For example, this will determine
what subnet Kubernetes uses for LoadBalancer type services in the
cluster.

[Back to table](#table-subnet-id)




### trust-device-path



<a id="trust-device-path-description"> </a>
**Description:**

In most scenarios the block device names provided by Cinder (e.g.
/dev/vda) can not be trusted. This boolean toggles this behavior. Setting
it to true results in trusting the block device names provided by Cinder.
The value of false results in the discovery of the device path
based on its serial number and /dev/disk/by-id mapping and is the
recommended approach.  If not set, will use the upstream default.
