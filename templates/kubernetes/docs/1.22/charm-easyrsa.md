This charm delivers the EasyRSA application to act as a Certificate Authority
(CA) and create certificates for related charms.

## Deployment

To deploy EasyRSA:

```
juju deploy cs:~containers/easyrsa
```

## Using the EasyRSA charm

The EasyRSA charm will become a Certificate Authority (CA) and generate a CA
certificate. Other charms need only to relate to EasyRSA with a requires
using the `tls-certificates` interface.

To get a server certificate from EasyRSA, a charm must include the
`interface:tls-certificates` interface in its `layer.yaml` file. The charm must
also require the `tls` interface, in its `metadata.yaml`. The relation name may
be named what ever you wish. Assume the relation is named "certificates" for
these examples.

### CA

The interface will generate a CA certificate immediately. If another charm
requires a CA certificate the code must react to the flag
`certificates.ca.available`. The relationship object has a method named
`get_ca` which returns the CA certificate.

```python
@when('certificates.ca.available')
def store_ca(tls):
    '''Read the certificate authority from the relation object and install it
    on this system.'''
    # Get the CA from the relationship object.
    ca_cert = tls.get_ca()
    write_file('/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/easyrsa.crt', ca_cert)
```

### Client certificate and key

The EasyRSA charm generates a client certificate after the CA certificate is
created. If another charm needs the CA the code must react to the flag
`certificates.client.cert.available`. The relationship object has a method
that returns the client cert and client key called `get_client_cert`.

```python
@when('certificates.client.cert.available')
def store_client(tls):
    '''Read the client certificate from the relation object and install it on
    this system.'''
    client_cert, client_key = tls.get_client_cert()
    write_file('/home/ubuntu/client.crt', client_cert)
    write_file('/home/ubuntu/client.key', client_key)
```

### Request a server certificate

The interface will set `certificates.available` flag on a relation. The
reactive code should send three values on the relation to request a
certificate. Call the `request_server_cert` method on the relationship object.
The three values are: Common Name (CN), a list of Subject Alt Names (SANs), and
the file name of the certificate (the unit name with the '/' replaced with an
underscore). For example a client charm would send:

```python
@when('certificates.available')
def send_data(tls):
    # Use the public ip of this unit as the Common Name for the certificate.
    common_name = hookenv.unit_public_ip()
    # Get a list of Subject Alt Names for the certificate.
    sans = []
    sans.append(hookenv.unit_public_ip())
    sans.append(hookenv.unit_private_ip())
    sans.append(socket.gethostname())
    # Create a path safe name by removing path characters from the unit name.
    certificate_name = hookenv.local_unit().replace('/', '_')
    # Send the information on the relation object.
    tls.request_server_cert(common_name, sans, certificate_name)
```

### Server certificate and key

The Easy-RSA charm generates the server certificate and key after the request
have been made. If another charm needs the server certificate the code must
react to the flag `{relation_name}.server.cert.available`. The relationship
object has a method that returns the server cert and server key called
`get_server_cert`.

```python
@when('certificates.server.cert.available')
def store_server(tls):
    '''Read the server certificate from the relation object and install it on
    this system.'''
    server_cert, server_key = tls.get_server_cert()
    write_file('/home/ubuntu/server.cert', server_cert)
    write_file('/home/ubuntu/server.key', server_key)
```

### Backup/Restore the PKI

This charm includes actions which support creating and managing snapshots
of the Easy-RSA PKI. Their usage is explained in the following sections:

#### Create backups

Use the charm's `backup` action to capture current snapshot of the Easy-RSA PKI.
This will generate a file in the directory `/home/ubuntu/easyrsa_backup` on the
relevant unit. The backup file follows the naming convention:
`easyrsa-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.tar.gz`.

For example:

```bash
juju run-action --wait easyrsa/0 backup
```

For convenience, the output of the `backup` action will output the exact
`juju scp` command to download the created file to your local machine.

#### List backups

To list all the available backup files stored on the unit, run the following:

```bash
juju run-action --wait easyrsa/0 list-backups
```

This will output a list of filenames. These filenames are relative to the
unit's `/home/ubuntu/easyrsa_backup/` directory.

The names can be used either directly as a parameters for the
`restore` and `delete-backup` actions or as part of a `juju scp` command to
download the backup files. For example, to download a backup named
`easyrsa-2020-12-10_16-37-54.tar.gz`, the corresponding `juju scp` command
would be:

```bash
juju scp easyrsa/0:/home/ubuntu/easyrsa_backup/easyrsa-2020-12-10_16-37-54.tar.gz .
```

#### Delete backups

To delete a backup file stored on the unit, simply run action `delete-backup`
with parameter `name=<backup_name>`. List of all available backups can be
obtained by running action `list-backups`. To remove all the backups from the
unit, you can specify parameter `all=true`.

Removing a single backup:

```bash
juju run-action --wait easyrsa/0 delete-backup name=easyrsa-2020-12-10_16-37-54.tar.gz
```

Removing all backups:

```
juju run-action --wait easyrsa/0 delete-backup all=true
```

#### Restore backups

To restore a backup, run the `restore` action. This action takes one
parameter, `name`, which specifies the backup file to be restored. This file
must exist on the easyrsa unit for the action to succeed. A list of the
available backups can be obtained by running the `list-backups` action.

For example:

```bash
juju run-action --wait easyrsa/0 restore name=easyrsa-2020-06-10_16-37-54.tar.gz
```

In the case where the backup file is available locally, it can be copied to
the relevant unit before running the restore action by using the `juju scp`
command. For example:

```bash
juju scp easyrsa-2020-12-10_16-37-54.tar.gz easyrsa/0:/home/ubuntu/easyrsa_backup/
```

In the case where units have been added to the Juju model since the
backup was created, Easy-RSA will issue new certificates to these
units.

## Actions

This section covers Juju actions supported by the charm.
Actions allow specific operations to be performed on a per-unit basis. To
display action descriptions you can run `juju actions easyrsa`, inspect
the charm's `actions.yaml` file or consult the table below:
