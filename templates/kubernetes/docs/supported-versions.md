## Charmed Kubernetes bundle versions

**Charmhub.io** hosts Charmed Kubernetes bundles as well as
individual charms. To deploy the latest stable bundle, run the command:

```bash
juju deploy charmed-kubernetes
```

It is also possible to deploy a specific version of the bundle by including
the `--channel` argument. For example, to deploy the Charmed Kubernetes
bundle for the Kubernetes 1.28 release, run the command:

```bash
juju deploy charmed-kubernetes --channel=1.28/stable
```

It is still possible to deploy older, unsupported versions of Charmed Kubernetes.
Older bundle files are available for download in the [releases][] directory of
the Charmed Kubernetes bundle repository. These can be downloaded and deployed with
Juju as with any local bundle file.

Only the latest three versions of Charmed Kubernetes are supported at any time.
