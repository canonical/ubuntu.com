          What is Kubernetes?
        </h1>
        <p>
          Kubernetes, or k8s for short, is an open source platform, pioneered by Google, which started as a simple container orchestration tool but has grown into a cloud-native platform.  It's one of the most significant advancements in IT since the public cloud came to being in 2009 and has an unparalleled <a class="p-link--external" href="https://451research.com/451-research-says-application-containers-market-will-grow-to-reach-4-3bn-by-2022">5-year 30% growth rate</a> in both market revenue and overall adoption.

          We asked Devs, DevOps and businesses to tell us how they are using Kubernetes, and it is a fascinating read.

        Kubernetes maps out how applications should work and interact with other applications. Due to its elasticity, it can scale services up and down as required, perform rolling updates, switch traffic between different versions of your applications to test features or rollback problematic deployments.

        What are containers?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Containers are a technology that allows the user to divide up a machine so that it can run more than one application (in the case of process containers) or operating system instance (in the case of system containers) on the same kernel and hardware while maintaining isolation among the workloads. Containers are a modern way to virtualise infrastructure, more lightweight approach than traditional virtual machines: all containers in single host OS share the kernel and other resources, require less memory space, ensure greater resource utilisation and shorter startup times by several orders of magnitude.

        Kubernetes (from the Greek 'κυβερνήτης' meaning 'helmsman') was originally developed by Google, Kubernete's design has been heavily influenced by Google's 'Borg' project – a similar system used by Google to run much of its infrastructure. Kubernetes has since been donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, a collaborative project between the Linux Foundation and Google, Cisco, IBM, Docker, Microsoft, AWS and VMware.

        How does Kubernetes work?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Kubernetes works by joining a group of physical or virtual host machines referred to as "nodes", into a cluster to manage containers. This creates a "supercomputer" that has greater processing speed, more storage capacity and increased network capabilities than any single machine would have on its own. The nodes include all necessary services to run "pods", which in turn run single or multiple containers. A pod corresponds to a single instance of an application in Kubernetes.
      </p>
      <p>
        One (or more for larger clusters, or High Availability) node of the cluster is designated as the "control plane". The control plane node then assumes responsibility for the cluster as the orchestration layer - scheduling and allocating tasks to the other "worker" nodes in a way which maximises the resources of the cluster. All operator interaction with the cluster goes through this master node, whether that is changes to the configuration, executing or terminating workloads, or controlling ingress and egress on the network.
      </p>
      <p>
        The control plane is also responsible for monitoring all aspects of the cluster, enabling it to perform additional useful functions such as automatically reallocating workloads in case of failure, scaling up tasks which need more resources and otherwise ensuring that the assigned workloads are always operating correctly.

Kubernetes allows their work to move seamlessly from development to production and results in faster-time-to-market for a businesses' applications.

          What Kubernetes is not
        </h2>
        <p>
          Kubernetes is a platform that enables configuration, automation and management capabilities around containers. It has a vast tooling ecosystem and can address complex use cases, and this is the reason why many confuse it for a traditional Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to distinguish between the two solutions. Kubernetes, as opposed to PaaS does not:

            MicroK8s is a production-grade, CNCF-certified, lightweight Kubernetes that deploys a single-node cluster with a single command. It's a Linux snap that runs all Kubernetes services natively on Ubuntu, or any operating system that supports snaps, including 20+ Linux distributions, Windows and macOS.
          </p>
          <p>
            MicroK8s is the simplest distribution of Kubernetes, and tears down the barrier of entry to container orchestration and cloud-native development. Because of its small footprint, it is ideal for clusters, workstations, CI/CD pipelines, IoT devices, and small edge clouds.

          <p>
            It's tested across the widest range of infrastructure and deploys on bare-metal, private and public clouds. Along with our Kubernetes, Canonical supports a rich ecosystem of different pieces of software that can be integrated from the stack up. Canonical is one of Microsoft's primary development partners as Ubuntu is the operating system of choice on AKS.

            Canonical offers a fully managed service which manages the complex operations that many may lack the skills to do, such as installing, patching, scaling, monitoring, and upgrading with zero downtime.

            If you have clusters built, we can manage them for you.  We can also build and manage them for you, handing the keys over when and if you're ready to take full control.
