The [Snap store](http://snapcraft.io/store) is a global application repository hosted and managed by Canonical. It is accessible to any developer who wants to leverage snaps to distribute software across any Linux distribution.

This section describes how to publish a snap in the global repository (snap store) or your own private repository (IoT app store). Applications published benefit from Canonical's content delivery network (CDN) for global software delivery.

IoT app stores are private application repositories hosted and managed by Canonical. Access to IoT app stores is restricted to the repository owner's team, customers, users and business partners.
