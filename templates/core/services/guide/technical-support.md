Technical support is included in the SMART START bundle for the first year. Technical support enables access to Canonical Engineering and TechOps teams to troubleshoot and resolve issues.

## Conditions

Canonical provides technical support within the scope of SMART START under one of the following conditions:

* Your devices are built on [pre-certified](/smart-start/guide/hardware-setup) single-board computers
* Canonical built your kernel as part of the [device enablement ](/smart-start/guide/device-enablement) service

## Process

Canonical provides you with access to the[ support portal](http://support.canonical.com). The support portal is the preferred channel for opening support cases. For emergency cases, customers will also have access to telephone support.

## Response time and severity levels

Canonical provides a workaround or permanent solution as soon as possible, balanced against higher severity level cases. If a workaround is provided, Canonical's support engineers continue to work on developing a permanent resolution to the case.

The target initial response time for severity levels is 12 business hours, defined as Monday - Friday between 8:00 and 18:00 excluding public holidays.

## Customer involvement

Your involvement facilitates the delivery of technical support. The following contributions are expected:

* Resolving all issues your end-users face.
* Specifying how an issue arises and in what sub-system it is taking place.
* Providing a repeatable test case.
* Provide any debugging or further testing required.
* Provide technical information as requested to resolve the problem.
* Verifying issue resolution, once the final solution has been provided by Canonical.
