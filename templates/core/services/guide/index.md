Bringing IoT products to market requires varied capabilities ranging from embedded engineering, app development, backend hosting, software update infrastructure, maintenance and after-sales customer support. Deploying these capabilities at scale typically requires large upfront investments.The complexity involved in acquiring and orchestrating these capabilities delays time-to-market.

SMART START brings agility to enterprise IoT projects. Through this bundle enterprises embrace a lean methodology for IoT product commercialisation. Innovative companies can leverage this offering to bring the first version of a product to market quickly. SMART START enables enterprises to carry out product discovery and gather initial customer feedback, without committing more resources to scaling their product.
