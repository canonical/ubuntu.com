Board certification for Ubuntu is a prerequisite for commercialisation with SMART START. Canonical has [certified a selection x86 and ARM-based](https://certification.ubuntu.com/iot) off-the-shelf boards for Ubuntu. Customers can choose one, and benefit from the shortest time to market (two weeks delivery). Alternatively, customers can purchase [Canonical's device enablement](/smartstart/guide/device-enablement) service as an add-on to get any board on their choice certified for Ubuntu.

## Certified boards

Boards certified for Ubuntu span x86, ARM, 32bit and 64bit architectures. These boards are generally available in development versions and industrial-grade versions. Certified boards are listed below.

## Device enablement

SMART START customers can choose Canonical's [device enablement](/smart-start/guide/device-enablement) service (see [advanced options](/smart-start/guide/advanced-options)) to get any board of their choice certified for Ubuntu. Canonical then provides an Ubuntu Kernel for the device.

Canonical also can port drivers and board support packages to Ubuntu. Once certified, devices are continuously tested in Canonical certification labs and so benefit from long term [technical support](/smart-start/guide/technical-support).
