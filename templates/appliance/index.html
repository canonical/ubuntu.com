        No need for a spare disk or board, just follow the steps and you'll be up and running in seconds. Virtual Ubuntu Appliances work on Ubuntu, Windows and macOS.

        Certified, Maintained or Experimental

      <p>
        Some appliances are serious things, and you want to know that Canonical will keep them reliable, year after year. Those are marked 'certified', and they get constant testing and security coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other appliances have a company to keep the updates coming, for at least a certain time. Those are tagged 'maintained' and you can always see the minimum time assured of maintenance.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then there are the crazy things, the community things, the experimental things. Enjoy those, but don't get too attached. If enough people love them then they'll get maintenance commitments soon enough.
