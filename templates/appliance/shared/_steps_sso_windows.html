      Your Ubuntu Appliance will be added to your Ubuntu cloud account and use your SSH keys to identify you. Add your keys to your account at <a href="https://login.ubuntu.com/ssh-keys">https://login.ubuntu.com/ssh-keys</a>.

    <p>
      To do so, run the following command in your terminal, which will copy your public key to your keyboard.
