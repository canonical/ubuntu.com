          Now you can go ahead and set everything up.  It's usually best to wait 5-10 minutes here. Some snaps will need to refresh themselves and the appliance may need to automatically reboot. When you're ready go to:
        </p>
        <pre><code>http://&lt;IP-of-your-appliance&gt;:3000</code></pre>
        <p>
          in another computers browser. Where you will find the initial configuration wizard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Follow the instructions to start using your new Adguard Home Ubuntu Appliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the AdGuard configuration screen, under DNS Server, it will have an error in red: <code>listen udp 0.0.0.0:53: bind: address already in use</code>.  Change the listen interface to <code>Eth0</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you've finished the AdGuard configuration, you can connect to the admin panel by just going to <code>http://&lt;ip address&gt;</code> (no longer port 3000), and can configure other devices on your network to use that ip address for the DNS server.
        </p>

          For more information or more documentation on what to do now, the <a class="p-link--external" href="https://adguard.com/">AdGuard website</a> is the best place to go next.
