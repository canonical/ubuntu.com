        Now you can go ahead and set everything up.  It's usually best to wait 5-10 minutes here. Some snaps will need to refresh themselves and the appliance may need to automatically reboot. When you're ready go to:
      </p>
      <pre><code>http://&lt;IP-of-your-appliance&gt;:3000</code></pre>
      <p>in another computers browser. Where you will find the initial configuration wizard.</p>
      <p>Follow the instructions to start using your new Adguard Home Ubuntu Appliance.</p>
      <p>
        On the AdGuard configuration screen, under DNS Server, it will have an error in red: <code>listen udp 0.0.0.0:53: bind: address already in use</code>.  Change the listen interface to <code>Eth0</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you've finished the AdGuard configuration, you can connect to the admin panel by just going to <code>http://&lt;ip address&gt;</code> (no longer port 3000), and can configure other devices on your network to use that ip address for the DNS server.
      </p>

        For more information or more documentation on what to do now, the <a href="https://adguard.com/">AdGuard website</a> is the best place to go next.
