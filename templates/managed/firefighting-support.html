        <p>
          Whether you’re running a cloud based on <a href="/openstack">OpenStack</a> or <a href="https://canonical.com/microcloud">MicroCloud</a>, or using applications like Kafka, Kubeflow, Spark, or OpenSearch, operations management can be tough! That's why Canonical offers <a href="/managed">fully managed services</a>, which relieve you of that worry. However, be it due to security regulations or other issues, giving our engineers access to your environments is not something you can always do.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why we launched Firefighting Support, a package that gives you dual, highly-enhanced cloud support from Canonical's Support and Managed Solutions engineering teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          You thus get managed service level of security and peace of mind, while still completely managing your environments by yourself in full privacy.

            <p>
              Generally, governments and intergovernmental institutions have very stringent regulations that forbid third parties from providing direct operational management. This, however, does not make your operations easier. Firefighting Support gives you extra peace of mind while allowing you to remain fully compliant with your security policies.
