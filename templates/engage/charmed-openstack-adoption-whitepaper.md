OpenStack is one of the most active open source projects in the world. It is an essential component of private cloud infrastructure for countless businesses, and over the last few years, it has evolved to become the de-facto standard for implementing cloud computing platforms. Yet despite its popularity, many organisations still struggle with their OpenStack implementations.

Lack of resources, knowledge, experience, or tools can all stand in the way of a successful OpenStack deployment &mdash; but businesses can overcome these challenges by following a proven adoption process. Canonical provides consulting and tools to assist organisations at each stage of implementation and operation, taking all the complexity out of OpenStack deployment.

This whitepaper will explore each of the five phases of OpenStack adoption, and describe how Canonical’s tools and services can be used to optimise the process, including:

<ul class="p-list">
  <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Consulting to help design and implement an OpenStack private cloud, including delivery within two weeks</li>
  <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Using Canonical’s tooling to streamline OpenStack modelling, implementation, and orchestration</li>
  <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">The option for organisations to manage their OpenStack operations themselves, or have Canonical deliver fully managed OpenStack as a service</li>
</ul>
