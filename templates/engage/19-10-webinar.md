Ubuntu 19.10 gives a boost to developer productivity through enhancements to Kubernetes and MicroK8s capabilities, ships with OpenStack Train updates that impact multi-cloud infrastructure economics and, as always, provides a streamlined desktop experience, including an experimental ZFS file system option.

Highlights of the 19.10 release updates will be discussed between Ubuntu product, security and engineering teams in our upcoming webinar, ‘What’s new in Ubuntu 19.10’.

In this webinar you will learn about:

- New edge and AI capabilities for [Kubernetes](/kubernetes) for a secure, production-grade Kubernetes environment
- The inclusion of [OpenStack](/openstack) Train updates, including live-migration to aid infrastructure operations
- Additional hardware support, including the Raspberry Pi 4 and NVIDIA drivers enabled in the desktop image
- Desktop performance improvements with GNOME 3.34, delivering a more responsive, smooth and organised experience

Join the Ubuntu team to learn about the full capabilities of the latest Ubuntu release, and see what updates and features will improve developer and infrastructure efficiency, from cloud to the edge.
