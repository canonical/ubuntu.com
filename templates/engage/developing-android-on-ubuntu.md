Android is the most popular mobile operating system and is continuing to grow its market share.  <a class="p-link--external" href="https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/os">IDC</a> expects that Android will have 85.5% of the market by 2022, demonstrating that app development on Android will continue to be an in-demand skill.

For developers looking to build Android apps, Ubuntu is the ideal platform in conjunction with Android Studio - the official Android development environment. Ubuntu features a wide variety of software development tools including numerous programming language compilers, integrated development environments (IDEs) and toolchains to enable developers to target multiple hardware platforms.

Developers using Ubuntu will be enabled to write an Android app and deploy it to emulated and physical devices using standard tooling all from their desktop.
