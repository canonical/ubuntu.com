        <p>Linux software developers historically have faced a number of challenges including fragmentation, distribution complexity and a lack of metrics into the success of their applications. Once an application is built, the journey does not end there - for companies and individual developers creating apps,  thought needs to be given to promoting their software for maximum visibility, usage and customer experience. </p>

        <blockquote class="p-pull-quote"><p>Applications within the ‘Featured’ section of Linux app stores can see up to 40% install growth within two weeks of being featured.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Self-contained application formats like AppImage, Flatpak and snaps and the shift to an application store model offer a viable, data-driven alternative to the classic methods. This new approach can help overcome some of the historical challenges while improving visibility to enterprises and end users.</p>

        <p>This whitepaper will take a closer look at how software developers targeting the desktop market, in particular, can benefit from moving their applications to a Linux app store including: </p>

        <ul class="p-list">
          <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">An evaluation of the packaging formats, distributions and considerations that software developers should review.</li>

          <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">The adoption of application stores: how software developers can maximise their presence and apply lessons from other industries.</li>

          <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">A series of case studies highlighting successful apps that have an optimised store presence including Spotify, Visual Studio Code and Skype. </li>
