This document provides a complete reference architecture guide for Charmed OpenStack (Rocky) solution on Dell EMC hardware delivered by Canonical, including Dell EMC PowerEdge servers for workloads and storage and Dell EMC Networking.

This guide discusses the Dell EMC hardware specifications and the tools and services to set up both the hardware and software, including the foundation cluster and the OpenStack cluster. It also covers other tools used for the monitoring and management of the cluster in detail and how all these components work together in the system. The guide also provides the deployment steps and references to configuration developed by Dell EMC and Canonical for the deployment process.
