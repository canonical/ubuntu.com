      <p>
        In this webinar, we will discuss how Ubuntu Core leverages the latest security enhancements from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and combines this with the secure, always-up-to-date and transactional nature of snaps to provide the best platform on which to build IoT devices. This webinar also details upcoming security enhancements on the future roadmap for Ubuntu Core.
