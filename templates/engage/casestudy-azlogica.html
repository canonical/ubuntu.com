      <p>Shrimps are now considered as the most lucrative sea food product with demand growing from consumers due to their high nutritional value. Due to their perishable nature, it is imperative for shrimp producers to maximise their profitability and reduce the risk of wasted stock either from theft, unfavourable weather conditions or a sub-optimal production environment - particularly with increasing demand and high revenue opportunities at stake.</p>
