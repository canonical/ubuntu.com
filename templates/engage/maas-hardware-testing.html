          For organisations looking to turn the management of bare-metal server resources into a cloud-like environment, hardware testing is a must-do. 
          Not only does it lead to optimal hardware utilisation, it also reduces the cost of operations and increases developer productivity. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Optimised testing also eases the hardware validation process by providing a framework that allows large-scale, automated testing of hardware with minimum effort to ensure that the physical infrastructure is ready to serve production workloads. Welcome to metal-as-a-service (MAAS).

          In this whitepaper, you will learn how MAAS provides a flexible and straightforward framework for administrators to test their hardware:
