## About the event

As TSPs (telecommunications service providers) worldwide strive to keep up with growing demand and evolving customer needs, the industry relies heavily on new technologies that allow for cost savings, more and more flexibility, speed, and robustness.

Today, it is clear that the growth path for operators lies in the transition from traditional VNFs to cloud-native, containerised network services based on microservices architectures that can meet requirements for 5G and beyond.

However, understanding infrastructure implications and design considerations for open source hardware and software development platforms, while remaining carrier-grade and maintaining operational excellence and capacity, requires careful planning and thorough understanding of the available options.

Join our live virtual event and our telco experts to discuss:

<ul class="p-list">
  <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Major trends and challenges in the current telco landscape</li>
  <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Best tools and strategies to reduce CAPEX and OPEX costs</li>
  <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Optimal solutions around Kubernetes, OpenStack, and OSM (Open Source MANO)</li>
  <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Opportunities for telcos at the edge</li>
  <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Canonical's portfolio of products and services for telcos</li>
</ul>

The speakers will also delve into notable use cases they have come across throughout their experience, as well as touch on topics and questions put forward by the audience live.
