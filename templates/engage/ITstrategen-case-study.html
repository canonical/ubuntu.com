        <p>Extended Security Maintenance (ESM) extends official support for the operating system, guaranteeing the continued security of ITstrategen’s servers and saving its clients from costly application updates.</p>
        <p>As the five-year support window for Ubuntu 12.04 came to an end, some of ITstrategen’s customers still depended on servers running the now out of support operating system and without support, the security of those servers was at risk. To tackle this issue, ITstrategen decided to purchase Extended Security Maintenance (ESM) for Ubuntu 12.04, a service offered as part of their Ubuntu Advantage subscription.</p>
