    <p>Blender has partnered with Canonical to offer enterprise-grade support for the Blender LTS application suite.</p>
    <p>Blender is the free and open-source 3D creation suite for artists and media production experts. Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, provides professional enterprise support and long term security maintenance for open-source software. Working together, the two organizations now offer a support path for teams and studios as Blender rolls out their LTS model focused on users at the enterprise level.</p>
    <p>The support offering will include Blender LTS releases across Linux distributions, Microsoft Windows, and macOS. Canonical’s engineers will engage directly with customers to provide comprehensive technical support to users by understanding, diagnosing and resolving issues as swiftly as possible. Canonical will manage the entire support process including integration with Blender’s support infrastructure.</p>
    <p>Existing Canonical Ubuntu Advantage customers who contract for Blender support will have a single point of contact to guarantee simple, timely support of Blender LTS users.</p>
