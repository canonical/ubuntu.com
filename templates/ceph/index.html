    <h2>Ceph storage deployment and operations</h2>
    <p>Canonical can help you to design and install your Ceph cluster or provide consulting to enable you to run Ceph autonomously. If you are interested in having automated Ceph Day-2 operations, you can opt for our offerings of Charmed Ceph, a Ceph cluster encapsulated in Juju charms. If you prefer to treat your storage as-a-service, we offer Managed Ceph &mdash; a Ceph cluster fully managed by Canonical.</p>
    <h3>Benefits of Ceph on Ubuntu</h3>
    <p>The choice is yours as to whether to use your own operational framework or leverage the advantages of Charmed Ceph. Each Ubuntu LTS release ships a version of Ceph that is supported for up to 10 years. Newer releases of Ceph can be installed from the Ubuntu Cloud Archive, allowing flexibility for selecting the right version of Ceph for your environment. To maximise Ceph upgrade flexibility for customers, Ceph versions are regularly released and maintained via Ubuntu updates and security repositories, as well as the Ubuntu Cloud Archive. This leads to a flexible mix between remaining at the forefront of innovation and providing long-term support predictability.</p>
    <p>With many global enterprises and telco operators running Ceph on Ubuntu, organisations are able to combine block, file and object storage at scale while tapping into the economic and upstream benefits of open source.</p>
