			<h2>Ceph implementation challenges</h2>
			<p>Designing an optimised storage solution for any use case requires expert level knowledge, and many years of experience. </p>
			<p>Common questions that arise during design and build:</p>
			<ul class="p-list">
				<li class="p-list__item is-ticked"> Which deployment tooling should I use? </li>
				<li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Which version of Ceph should I install? </li>
				<li class="p-list__item is-ticked">What CPUs, Memory, Disks, NICs should I buy?</li>
				<li class="p-list__item is-ticked">How do I configure my network?</li>
				<li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Which workloads are suitable for Ceph?</li>
				<li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Can I use Ceph for traditional workloads too?</li>
				<li class="p-list__item is-ticked">How can I secure my cluster?</li>
				<li class="p-list__item is-ticked">How can I prepare for Disaster Recovery?</li>
			</ul>
			<p> Canonical's Ceph consultants can help guide you through these and many other questions related to deploying a cost-effective and fit for purpose Ceph storage system for a fixed price. </p>

		<p>Canonical offers two Ceph cluster consulting packages, Ceph Cluster Build (CCB), and Ceph Cluster Build Plus (CCB Plus). CCB is a basic package to get your Ceph cluster up and running in a simplified configuration, and CCB Plus offers more consulting time to evaluate your needs and customise the deployment architecture as required. </p>
