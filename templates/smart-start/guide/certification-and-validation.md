Device certification keeps devices secure with security fixes and bug fixes over the life of the certified release (and the next LTS). Several instances of the target device model will undergo regular testing in our certification lab. Continuous testing ensures that updates do not cause regressions.

In the case regressions are found, Canonical is committed to fix the issues promptly. Ubuntu Certified devices are listed on our [certification website](http://certification.ubuntu.com/iot). Canonical assigns a dedicated engineer as the point of contact for each Ubuntu Certified device.

In order to be granted Ubuntu certification, devices must first undergo rigorous testing by Canonical QA to ensure that Ubuntu running on the system meets Canonical’s standards. Once testing is complete Canonical issues a [certificate](http://certification.ubuntu.com), and the system will be placed into the certification lab to undergo continuous testing.

## Device validation

Device validation entails regular testing in our lab of several units of a target device for all kernel/OS updates, prior release to end users.

The scope of testing under device validation is low-level software testing, rather than supported apps/tools. Validation does not confer Ubuntu Certified status to target devices.
