    </div>
    <div class="col-7">
      <p>The face of retail banking is changing rapidly as the industry works to facilitate customer engagement while reducing the costs associated with building and operating traditional bank branches. One approach is the micro-branch &ndash; a fully functional bank branch that has been dramatically reduced in size. Micro-branches are cost-effective and enable banks to adapt to the evolving needs and expectations of their customers. In this episode, <a href="https://marketscale.com/shows/to-the-edge-and-beyond/">To the Edge and Beyond</a> spoke with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/devakumar-r-12156b107/">Devakumar Rajagopalan</a>, Banking Segment Marketing Manager for <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/internet-of-things/overview.html">The Intel Internet of Things Group</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/srikrishna-kris-sharma/">Srikrishna "Kris" Sharma</a>, Financial Services Industry Leader with <a href="https://canonical.com/">Canonical</a>, about the innovative technologies and deployment strategies that are making micro-branches a reality.</p>
