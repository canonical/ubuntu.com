      <p>As per the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/legal/intellectual-property-policy">IPRights Policy</a>, Canonical owns and manages certain intellectual property rights in Ubuntu and other associated intellectual property (Canonical IP) and licenses the use of these rights to enterprises, individuals and members of the Ubuntu community in accordance with the IPRights Policy.</p>
      <p>Our policy exists to ensure that when you receive something that claims to be Ubuntu, you can trust that it will work to the same standard, regardless of where you got it from. And people everywhere tell us they appreciate that - when they get Ubuntu on a cloud or as a VM, it works, and they can trust it.</p>

      <h2 class="p-heading--5">Q. What is a modification?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      <p>A. There are many examples of what might be a modification to Ubuntu, including modifying or replacing the kernel, removing or adding packages, theme changes and pre-installation. Ubuntu is available to download in the form of an ISO installation image with DEB files. If a customer was to distribute the unmodified ISO installation image in the same format on a CD or server, this would be unmodified Ubuntu.</p>
