          Ubuntu Pro patches are not just automatically pulled from upstream, they're retrieved, evaluated, curated, tested, and backported by Canonical's dedicated security team to ensure production reliability. Each fix is traceable and published in our CVE Tracker.

          Canonical delivers proactive, production-grade patching across thousands of open source components, so you can focus on building, not backporting.

          Securing modern infrastructure means more than patching the operating system. You also need to secure everything that runs on top of your OS, including runtimes, ML frameworks, and application stacks. It requires tracking thousands of CVEs, validating fixes, and updating a complex web of dependencies across the entire open source stack.

        <p>
          With Ubuntu Pro, that complexity is handled for you by the team that knows Ubuntu best. Canonical delivers proactive fast, expert-driven remediation to keep your risk window minimal. It's the most cost-effective way to protect your open source supply chain, reducing operational overhead and ensuring compliance.
