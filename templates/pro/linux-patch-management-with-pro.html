          Ubuntu Pro patches are not just automatically pulled from upstream, they're retrieved, evaluated, curated, tested, and backported by Canonical's dedicated security team to ensure production reliability. Each fix is traceable and published in our CVE Tracker.
        </p>
        <p>
          Canonical delivers proactive, production-grade patching across thousands of open source components, so you can focus on building, not backporting.
