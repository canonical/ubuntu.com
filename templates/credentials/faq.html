        <!-- Section 1 -->
        <h2 id="about" style="font-weight: 600">About the exams</h2>
        <h3>Is this a certificate program or a certification program? What’s the difference?</h3>
        <p>
          Our program combines the rigor of professional certification with the skills validation of a qualification program. Each professional track denotes that the successful candidate is qualified to perform the occupation to Canonical standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast, some organizations may offer a “certificate”, which does not validate professional competency, but indicates the completion of something, such as a training exercise, an online course, or a workshop. Canonical University does not provide certificates.
        </p>
        <p>
          The SysAdmin qualification can be earned by completing four exams: Using Linux Terminal, Using Ubuntu Desktop, Using Ubuntu Server, and a fourth exam to be formally announced soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our exams assess and verify professional competence according to an industry standard based on isolating tasks commonly associated with an occupational  role, identifying the priority and criticality of each task to the role, and creating assessment exercises and items in proportion to these priorities. This process is governed by methodologies agreed upon by multiple training, talent development, customer education, and formal academic bodies. Successful performance on an exam verifies occupational competence, and as such, the creation and implementation of skills assessments are held to the highest standards of instructional design.
        </p>

        <h3>How long is each exam?</h3>
        <p>
          Each exam has different degrees of complexity in content, and differing amounts of time are allowed depending on the exam.. The System Administrator: Using Linux Terminal exam currently allows 75 minutes for completion, although more experienced candidates may finish in as little as 45 minutes More advanced exams are estimated to take closer to 90 minutes.
        </p>

        <h3>How long does it take to achieve a Canonical qualification?</h3>
        <p>
          Each occupational track has different requirements, and exams can be taken at your own pace. For instance, the SysAdmin track  requires a passing score on all four exams: Using Linux Terminal, Using Ubuntu Desktop, Using Ubuntu Server, Managing Complex Systems, with each exam lasting between 60-90 minutes depending on test taker proficiency and speed.
        </p>

        <h3>How are scores determined?</h3>
        <p>
          Each item’s score is weighted based on the steps, complexity, and importance to the occupational role as determined by a panel of industry experts. Items are also reviewed continuously for item quality using industry-standard assessment metrics. Each overall exam score is based on subject matter experts’ (SMEs’) assessment via a standard “cut score” methodology. The 2024 edition of Using Linux Terminal has a passing score of 70. These scores may change with exam updates due to the nature of this calculation.
        </p>

        <h3>Do you have to take the exams in numerical order?</h3>
        <p>
          No. If an exam is available, you may take it. Exams may be taken individually or combined to form the overall qualification according to the needs of the test taker.
        </p>

        <h3>Why does my badge say 2024 when I took the exam in 2025 or early 2026?</h3>
        <p>
          Exams are based on the year of the LTS running on test nodes. The 2024 exams are all based on 24.04 (Noble Numbat), and will not change again until the 2026 exams are available for the 26.04 LTS cycle.
        </p>

        <h3>What happens if I pass all four Canonical SysAdmin exams?</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to the Credly badges received for each exam, passing candidates will also be recognized as a qualified Canonical SysAdmin and receive an additional badge.What is the profile of a qualified Canonical SysAdmin?
        </p>
        <p>
          Successful completion of all four exams indicates a well-rounded knowledge of Linux Terminal, Ubuntu Desktop, and Ubuntu Server. Canonical SysAdmins are able to troubleshoot, configure, install, and maintain systems, processes, and general activities associated with using Linux, Ubuntu Desktop, and Ubuntu Server as a system administrator or IT professional. Subject matter depth is validated by several practical hands-on challenges and subject matter breadth is evaluated by a number of multiple-choice questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Qualified Canonical SysAdmins are invited to return for future professional tracks covering Cloud, DevOps, and more.
        </p>

        <h3>What is each exam like?</h3>
        <p>
          Each exam provides an in-browser remote desktop interface into a functional Ubuntu Desktop environment running GNOME. From this initial node, you will be expected to troubleshoot, configure, install, and maintain systems, processes, and other general activities associated with managing Linux. The exam is a hybrid format featuring multiple choice, scenario-based, and performance-based questions. Exam instructions, timer, and exam questions will be provided in a browser inside the primary exam host node.
        </p>

        }}

        <h3>How is exam content validity and relevance determined?</h3>
        <p>
          All exam content is based on industry standard best practices for technical certification. Exam scope is determined by extensive industry analysis, including job listings, technical experts, college curriculum, and ultimately a survey of industry professionals to determine the occupational relevance of exam domains and exercises. Items are written and reviewed with feedback from subject matter experts and are continuously monitored for item quality and performance metrics.
        </p>

        <h3>
          What happened to Canonical Ubuntu Essentials? Is my CUE.01 Linux badge still valid? Do I need to retake my exam?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Canonical Ubuntu Essentials was a three-exam program designed to introduce fundamental skills to early career professionals. In response to support from the community and industry, Canonical recognized the need to expand this idea into more areas of experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The three exam model has been expanded to our exams to accommodate more troubleshooting, deployment, and automation techniques used by enterprise professionals, and more exams in cloud engineering and DevOps are in development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Program participants who have started studying for the former CUE.02 Desktop and CUE.03 Server exams may wish to review the exam content listed for the SysAdmin track due to some minor updates, and the addition of a fourth exam (currently in development). CUE.01 Linux will not change between the 24.04 version and the Using Linux Terminal 2024 exam, and all badge holders will automatically receive updated badges for the new program. Note that there will be minor changes when Using Linux Terminal 2026 is released in mid-2026.
        </p>
        <p>CUE.01 Linux Beta users will be required to take the updated exam to complete the SysAdmin qualification.</p>

        <h3>How long is my Canonical University Exam badge valid?</h3>
        <p>
          Each exam badge can be combined and applied toward a qualification or track for two years, but each certification is marked with the corresponding year of the exam Ubuntu releases. This allows prospective employers to know exactly how recent your experience is without the implication that those skills expire.  (2024 test takers should scroll down to “How do I apply for my Canonical SysAdmin badge? What happens if I take both 2024 and 2026 editions of the exam?” for exceptions to the 2-year rule.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 2 -->
        <h2 id="before" style="font-weight: 600">Before your exam</h2>

        <h3>Am I ready to take a Canonical University Exam?</h3>
        <p>Ultimately, only you can make that decision, but some factors to consider:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The exams are designed for early career Ubuntu Linux system administrators and related IT professionals with experience managing Linux in professional and enterprise environments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Exams require practical, hands-on knowledge of Linux systems including deployment, maintenance, and operations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each exam is taken independently, and can be spaced out over time at your convenience to accommodate busy schedules and financial challenges.
          </li>
          <li>Exams can be retaken once per year.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The syllabus for each exam is available <a href="/credentials/exam-content">here</a>. If you are comfortable with the concepts mentioned, you are a good candidate.
        </p>

        <h3>Are there study materials available?</h3>
        <p>
          Each exam certifies that you have the essential Linux Terminal, Ubuntu Desktop, and Ubuntu Server knowledge expected of early career administrators and operators. Professionals with equivalent experience should not require additional training.
        </p>
        <p>
          Test-takers interested in the types of material covered on each exam can review links to tutorials and documentation on our website: <a href="/credentials/self-study">https://ubuntu.com/credentials/self-study</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that our study guide is not a comprehensive list of the subjects covered by Canonical University Exams.  While they provide a good starting point for your studies, however, candidates are expected to look further.
        </p>

        <h3>Am I able to schedule the exam in advance?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Once purchased, exams can be scheduled up to one year in the future. <em>[Note that complimentary preview and beta releases are only available for 30 days after purchase.]</em> Exam bookings require a minimum of three hours notice before taking your exam to allow for the environment to be provisioned and checked.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I reschedule if the time slot I chose doesn’t work for me?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. You can do so through the <a href="/credentials/your-exams">“Your exams”</a> interface up to 24 hrs prior to the exam time.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 3 -->
        <h2 id="environment" style="font-weight: 600">Taking the exam: Exam Environment</h2>

        <h3>How do I access the environment?</h3>
        <p>
          Exams will appear on your <a href="/credentials/your-exams">“Your exams”</a> page.
        </p>

        ) | safe
        }}

        <h3>What resources am I allowed to use while in an exam?</h3>
        <p>
          Individuals are discouraged from using reference materials from outside of the exam environment. All exam tasks, including connecting to other nodes, will occur within the browser-based exam environment and will not require any resources from the user’s host system. Exam securing or proctoring features may ask for permissions to your web camera, desktop screen, or microphone. You may also be asked to record your environment to verify a clear workspace.
        </p>

        <h3>May I use man pages?</h3>
        <p>
          Exam environments use <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Minimal" target="_blank">Minimal Ubuntu images</a> and have man pages pre-loaded on the initial node only.
        </p>

        <h3>What are the technical requirements of our environment?</h3>
        <p>
          Exam proctoring will require the use of your web camera and microphone, and will also require you screenshare your entire screen during the exam. No more than one display is allowed for the duration of the exam. Before entering the exam environment you will be asked to complete a systems check with our proctoring partner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Test takers are advised to use a Chromium-based browser. Firefox is NOT supported at this time. [NOTE: There is a known issue with keyboards and Firefox in the CUE.01 Linux 24.04 preview release at this time, which will be resolved in the CUE.01 Linux 24.10 exam release. We recommend using Chrome-based browsers at this time.] The exam is conducted via web browser, and any operating system capable of running a modern browser is acceptable.
        </p>

        <h3>What are the exam’s Linux distributions and desktop environments?</h3>
        <p>
          Once the environment is loaded, it will appear to be a default installation of Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) with a GNOME Desktop, Terminal, and other relevant tools. All other nodes in the exam environment are running Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS. Exam nodes run LTS versions of Ubuntu unless a performance based exercise requires otherwise. The particular LTS is indicated by the year of the exam. 2024 editions are available in 2025 because nodes in the exam environment are using 24.04 (Noble Numbat). The upcoming 2026 releases will be based on the 26.04 LTS and will be available once the LTS is released, stable, and the environment has been tested for updates.
        </p>

        <h3>Are there any technical restrictions?</h3>
        <p>
          Please note that due to the nature of a browser-based environment, some shortcuts may not be available. Of particular note is Ctrl-W, commonly used in text editors but also used to close your tab.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 4 -->
        <h2 id="proctoring" style="font-weight: 600">Taking the Exam: Proctoring</h2>

        <h3>Is this exam proctored?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Once released, exams will use AI-based proctoring technology to detect and escalate abnormalities. Exam securing or proctoring features may ask for permissions to your web camera or microphone, as well as to your desktop screen. All exams are recorded for auditing purposes, and exams with activity that looks fraudulent will be flagged for further evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants caught cheating will not be allowed retakes and may be banned from Canonical University exams for a short time or permanently, at the discretion of Canonical University staff.
        </p>

        <h3>Who is proctoring my exam?</h3>
        <p>
          Canonical has partnered with Proctor360 and exams are , in part, secured via their innovative AI prescreening technology. Your exam session, from browser to screen to room environment, is recorded and screened for abnormalities. These sessions are reviewed by AI as well as human proctors before badges are released. Test takers found to violate any rules listed in the exam honor code, terms and conditions, or proctoring rules will receive an automatic failure and ban from the entire program. If you believe your exam was flagged in error, reach out to the Canonical University Exams team at <a href="mailto:cue@canonical.com" target="_blank">cue@canonical.com</a> for an additional screening.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I contact Proctor360 Customer Service?</h3>
        <p>
          The fastest and most efficient way to get the help you need is to contact our testing support staff by <a href="https://support.proctor360.com/help/365012637" target="_blank">filling out this form</a>.  This will create a unique support issue in our system that will be routed to the most appropriate member of our team to help you.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I have to significantly alter my physical environment by covering up items on my wall or on my desk?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Exams do not need to be taken in a “clean room” environment, although workspaces should be clear of materials and there should be no visible notes or technical materials in the area, including hanging on walls.
        </p>

        <h3>Are there rules against talking to myself, covering my mouth, or using my hands in unusual ways?</h3>
        <p>
          Although there is not a live proctor, exams are reviewed and scanned for abnormalities that may indicate a violation of our honor code while allowing for innocent activities or nervous habits. Determination of honor code violation is at the discretion of Canonical University screeners.
        </p>

        <h3>What happens if I fail the proctor screening?</h3>
        <p>
          The initial system screening will detect abnormalities in your environment and alert Canonical University staff for additional review. The Canonical University team will review your environment to determine whether a violation has actually occurred. If the test taker has violated the policy, staff will determine the degree of violation and recommend taking action ranging from failing the exam and prohibiting retakes to fully banning the test taker from that and any future exams in the Canonical University program. Bans may be for one or more years, or permanent, and are at the sole discretion of Canonical University staff.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I have a ban or proctoring failure determination re-evaluated by Canonical University?</h3>
        <p>
          If, following our standard screening process, you believe we have made an error, you may petition for an audit by emailing the Canonical University Exams team at <a href="mailto:cue@canonical.com" target="_blank">cue@canonical.com</a>.

        <h2 id="examQuestions" style="font-weight: 600">Taking the Exam: Exam Questions</h2>

        <h3>What should I expect from the exam questions?</h3>
        <p>
          Each exam is a hybrid format featuring multiple choice, scenario-based, and performance-based questions. Test takers will engage with a virtual system and be expected to perform various administrative and operational tasks, as well as answer questions about specific system configurations or general Linux knowledge. Instructions for hands-on activities will be found to the right of the exam environment.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I have to answer in a particular order?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Questions may be answered in any order and you may move between sections or menus as you like. We recommend reviewing the questions, answering those you are most comfortable with first, and then returning to other questions. The last tab of the exam will show any questions that do not have an answer submitted. Once you have completed your exam, you will not be able to go back.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I change my answers to multiple choice questions?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, you can go back and edit your answers after answering and saving them. Make sure to do so before completing the exam because you will not be able to go back once it is submitted.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I flag any questions to return to them later?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you are able to mark items for review before completing the exam.</p>

        <!-- Section 6 -->
        <h2 id="problems" style="font-weight: 600">Problems during the exam</h2>

        <h3 id="problems-0">What happens if I close my browser tab during the exam?</h3>
        <p>
          Should you unintentionally close your environment, please return to the <a href="/credentials/your-exams">your-exams</a> to access it again or reopen the last closed tab. The exam timer will continue to run even if you are disconnected.
        </p>

        <h3>What happens if I destroy my node? Can I recover?</h3>
        <p>
          While some events may be nonfatal, please note that the environment is as realistic as possible. It is your responsibility to not put the system in an unrecoverable state. Should you disconnect from your testing environment during the exam, see section <a class="custom-link" href="#problems-0"><em>‘What happens if I close my browser tab during the exam?’</em></a>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="after" style="font-weight: 600">After the exam</h2>

        <h3>When will I receive my result?</h3>
        <p>
          Exams that do not receive a passing score are released immediately. Exams that receive a passing score are reviewed for abnormalities and honor code compliance before badges are issued. If you have not received a score in 48 hours, contact the Canonical University Exams team at <a href="mailto:cue@canonical.com">cue@canonical.com</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>How are badges issued?</h3>
        <p>
          Digital badges are issued through Credly. If you successfully pass your exam, an email with your badge information will be sent to the email used to take the exam.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I know which questions I got wrong?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Only the overall exam result is communicated to candidates. Detailed question scores are not made available at this time.
        </p>

        <h3>Will each question have the same score value?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Questions are graded based on complexity of steps or variety of skills needed to answer. Performance-based questions are more heavily weighted than multiple choice. Each exam item and lab step is scored based on how critical the skill is to the target occupation, as determined by a panel of industry experts. Items undergo further evaluation via item quality metrics, and exam scoring and individual items are improved or optimised on a regular and continuous basis. Final scores will be determined after item quality metrics have been performed.

        <h3>Am I allowed to retake exams?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Exams may be retaken one time within a calendar year. Please contact the Canonical University Exams team at <a href="mailto:cue@canonical.com">cue@canonical.com</a> if you have any concerns about retaking the exam.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have experienced a problem with your exam due to environmental defects, please contact the Canonical University Exams team at <a href="mailto:cue@canonical.com">cue@canonical.com</a> to ask about an exception and potential for additional retake.

        <h3>Will I get the same exam over again if I retake it?</h3>
        <p>
          No. There are multiple versions of each question, and exam variations are tracked and assigned accordingly. Retake exams will be pulled from a comparable, but different, group of questions, and our question bank is continuously reviewed and improved based on data gathered through item quality metrics and panel reviews by industry experts.

        <h3>
          How do I apply for my Canonical SysAdmin badge? What happens if I take both 2024 and 2026 editions of the exam?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Due to the program’s continuing development, 2024 exam takers will be allowed to extend their qualification or track beyond the 2-year limitation, and combine exams with 2026 editions. Qualified candidates will receive the 2024 SysAdmin badge unless they have taken more 2026 exams than 2024 edition, in which case they will receive the 2026 SysAdmin qualification.
