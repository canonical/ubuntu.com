    For mobile network operators and handset makers, Ubuntu represents an opportunity
    to revolutionise the handset market. Beautifully designed and with a huge developer
    following, it allows you to deliver a first class, differentiated mobile experience
    while retaining both control and monetisation of your services and apps. With the
    power to turn a phone into a PC, just by connecting it to a monitor, keyboard and
    mouse, it offers unique convergence features. Scopes, meanwhile, provide a new,
    faster way for users to access content and services.

      <p>Ubuntu allows you to control the entire service layer &mdash; the visual identity and the suite of digital life services &mdash; ensuring a consistent user experience. This gives you the opportunity to differentiate your handsets without fragmenting or forking the operating system. It&rsquo;s an opportunity to increase revenue that simply doesn&rsquo;t exist on other&nbsp;platforms.</p>

      <p>As well as integrating your content, functionality and branding, you can take over the management of your users&rsquo; financial interactions. You can integrate your own payment systems deep into the phone, via Ubuntu&rsquo;s unique frameworks. And while you can opt to use the default Ubuntu store for downloads and purchases, you can also customise it to showcase your services, or replace it with your own store. No other mobile platform makes it this easy to develop your own ecosystem and revenue streams.</p>
