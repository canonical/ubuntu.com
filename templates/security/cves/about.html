            The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system is used to identify, define, and catalogue publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
            Canonical keeps track of all CVEs affecting Ubuntu, and releases a <a href="/security/notices">security notice</a> when an issue is fixed.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our <a href="/security/cves">CVE database</a>, you can check which packages are affected by a given vulnerability for every supported Ubuntu version,
            and their statuses. We may also provide notes that can help you to better understand the impact of these vulnerabilities in an Ubuntu environment,
            and how we have fixed the issue.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="question-heading"
            id="security"
            style="scroll-margin-top: 5rem">Getting security updates</h2>
        <div class="p-section">
          <p>
            Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS) releases get up to 12 years of security maintenance and support. The initial <a href="/about/release-cycle">5 years</a>
            of standard security updates for packages in the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu">Ubuntu Main</a> repository comes out
            of the box together with fixes for packages in the Ubuntu Universe repository coming from the Ubuntu community and Debian.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additional security coverage from Canonical for all packages in Main and Universe is provided through an Ubuntu Pro subscription for 10 years.
            <a href="/pro">Ubuntu Pro</a> is free for personal use on up to 5 machines, or 50 machines for active Ubuntu community members. A further 2 years
            of security maintenance and support is provided with the paid Legacy Support add-on.
          </p>

          <h3>Automatic updates</h3>
          <p>
            Since 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu releases automatically apply most security updates daily by default. If you are using a release older than 16.04 LTS, you can
            <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates">enable unattended upgrades.</a>
          </p>

          <h3>Update manually</h3>
          <p>
            You can also get patches as soon as they become available by upgrading all your installed packages to the latest version. You can do this by running
            the following command in your terminal:
          </p>
          <p>
            <pre><code>sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade</code></pre>
          </p>
          <p>
            We recommend not to cherry-pick updates from individual packages. If no fix is available yet for a specific CVE, you can check if there is any mitigation
            or further information in the notes of the CVE page.
          </p>

          <h3>Get advanced security coverage with Ubuntu Pro</h3>
          <p>
            On top of the five years of free standard support for LTS releases, you can get <a href="/security/esm">Expanded Security Maintenance (ESM)</a> with an
            <a href="/pro">Ubuntu Pro</a> subscription. ESM provides 10 years of security updates for Ubuntu Main packages and 23,000+ Ubuntu Universe packages,
            including additional security updates from  Canonical for critical and high priority CVEs. Ubuntu Pro is free for personal use on up to 5 machines, or 50 machines for active Ubuntu community members.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ubuntu Pro also includes <a href="/security/livepatch">live kernel patching with Livepatch</a>, <a href="/security/fips">FIPS compliant security updates</a>,
            <a href="/robotics/ros-esm">extended support for ROS</a>, and more.
          </p>

          <h3>Fix a specific CVE with the Ubuntu Pro Client</h3>
          <p>
            If you want to get the fixes for a specific CVE, make sure you have the
            <a href="https://canonical-ubuntu-pro-client.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/tutorials/fix_intro/">Ubuntu Pro Client installed, updated and set up</a>.
            Then run this command on your terminal, replacing CVE-YYYY-XXXX with a valid CVE ID:
          </p>
          <p>
            <pre><code>sudo pro fix CVE-YYYY-XXXX</code></pre>
          </p>

            Security updates get distributed through several repositories. Some of them are
            <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu">public and freely available</a>, while some others require an
            <a href="/pro">Ubuntu Pro</a> subscription.

        <div class="p-section">
          <p>
            The Ubuntu Security team reviews new vulnerabilities when they are identified. If they affect packages distributed with supported Ubuntu releases, the team assesses the impact and assigns a priority level.
            Vulnerabilities are then addressed in order of priority level.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Ubuntu priority is based on many factors including severity, importance, risk, estimated number of affected users, software configuration, active exploitation, and other factors which may adjust the impact
            of certain vulnerabilities such as Ubuntu's <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features#Matrix">proactive security features</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are the guidelines that we generally use to assess the Ubuntu priority of a CVE. There may be cases in which we assign a priority level based on factors not accounted for in these guidelines.
            These priority levels are distinct from other published severity levels such as <a href="#cvss-scores">CVSS base scores</a>, either ours or from other sources such as those used in the
            <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">National Vulnerability Database</a>.

            The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document">open framework</a>
