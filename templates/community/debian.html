      <h1>Debian is the rock on which Ubuntu is built</h1>
      <p>Ubuntu builds on the Debian architecture and infrastructure and collaborates widely with Debian developers, but there are important differences. Ubuntu has a distinctive user interface, a separate developer community (though many developers participate in both projects) and a different release process.</p>
