      <p><strong>Version &mdash; June 2020</strong></p>
      <p>This legal notice tells you about the information we collect using MOTD &mdash; Message of the Day. "motd-news" is a package that makes a call periodically to Canonical servers to get updated news for support and informational purposes. An example of an MOTD is shown at the end of this notice. As part of sending the message information is also collected by Canonical as set out below.</p>

      <p>None of this data can be used to identify a machine or user.</p>
      <p>Along with this data, the IP address and other network information is transmitted to facilitate communication on the internet from the Ubuntu machine to Canonical. This information is not stored by Canonical.</p>
      <h2 id="how-do-you-disable-the-collection">How do you disable the collection?</h2>
      <p>Note that all of the system information may be shared with Canonical. If you would prefer that Canonical does not receive any item of system information, please do not consent to it being sent. You can disable this service as follows:</p>
      <p>/etc/default/motd-news has an <code>ENABLED=1</code> setting that if set to <code>0</code> will turn off this functionality.</p>
      <h2 id="why-do-we-collect-this-information">Why do we collect this information?</h2>
      <p>The purpose of sending the system information is so that Canonical can tailor the message returned by https://motd.ubuntu.com. This allows Canonical to make users aware of new features of Ubuntu or services from Canonical that would be interesting to the Ubuntu user on the command line.  For instance, something specific to only users with Intel CPUs, or specific to only users of older versions of Ubuntu.</p>
      <h2 id="what-do-we-do-with-your-information">What do we do with your information?</h2>
      <p>Your information is stored in our systems and may be processed by Canonical globally.</p>
      <h2 id="how-long-do-we-keep-your-information-for">How long do we keep your information for?</h2>
      <p>We keep the system information for so long as reasonably required in accordance with our record retention policy.</p>
      <h2 id="your-rights-over-your-system-information">Your rights over your system information</h2>
      <p>You can decide whether to share the system information with Canonical or not.</p>
      <p>If you do share the system information with Canonical we are unable to identify you against your system information, so we are unable to provide you with a copy of the system information or to delete the system information on request.</p>
