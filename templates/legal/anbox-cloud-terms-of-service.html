        <p>If you are entering into these Terms of Service on behalf of a company or legal entity, you represent that you have authority to bind such company or legal entity, its officers, employees and agents and all users who access the Service through the account, to these Terms of Service. "you" and "your" shall refer to the company or legal entity and such users. If you do not have such authority do not accept these Terms of Service.</p>
        <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. If you are between age 13 and 18, we require your parent's or legal guardian's consent to use of the Services, please contact us at legal@canonical.com.</p>

        <h2 id="account">3. Account</h2>
        <p>You will need an account to access and use the Service. We reserve the right to reject your request for an account or to immediately cancel or suspend your account and your use of the Services at any time if you do not comply with the following requirements. You must not attempt to create an account or use the Service if doing so would violate these Terms of Service. You must:</p>
        <ul class="p-list--divided">
          <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">have a Service account</li>
          <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">not use the Service for illegal or unauthorised purposes (or which encourage or permit illegal or authorised purposes), in infringement of a third party's' rights or otherwise in accordance with these Terms of Service</li>
          <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">not take any action or use the Service in any way that might bring Canonical into disrepute or affect the ability of Canonical to provide the Service</li>
          <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">not use the Service in any manner that might be libellous or defamatory, that contains threats or incites violence towards individuals or entities, or that violates the privacy rights of any third party</li>
          <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">not be located in or use the Services in an OFAC/EAR embargoed or sanctioned country or be on the U.S. Commerce Department's Denied Persons List, Entity List, or Unverified List</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In order to access the Anbox Cloud Demo you will require an invitation code and a Single Sign On account with Canonical. The invitation code in conjunction with your Single Sign On account will create an Anbox Cloud Demo account which will enable you to access the Anbox Cloud Demo.</p>

        <h2 id="changes">6. Changes</h2>
        <p>We aim to continually improve the delivery and content of the Service and accordingly may make changes to the Service throughout the trial.</p>
        <p>This Service is offered on a trial basis, and your use of this Service  will be limited to the period of your trial. New features may be added, but we may also modify or discontinue (temporarily or permanently) part of the Service, in part or in whole before the end of the trial period.</p>
        <p>In the event of a material change to the Service, we will notify you on your account page. What constitutes a material change in this circumstance will be determined by Canonical, in good faith and using common sense and reasonable judgment.</p>
        <p>Similarly, we may occasionally make changes to these Terms of Service and will notify you of material changes either by email or on your account page. If Canonical does make changes to these Terms of Service, all changes will go into effect at the time we post the updated Terms of Service on your account page or as otherwise notified at that time.</p>
