            <li class="p-list__item">Customer is responsible for the back-up of its data and software.  Canonical will not be liable for any loss, corruption, or damage to data or software.</li>
            <li class="p-list__item">If Customer engages Canonical to install or use any third party software or materials as part of the Services, Customer will have and maintain sufficient rights or licences to such software to allow Canonical to perform the Services.</li>

          <ol class="p-list--ordered-legal">
            <li class="p-list__item">During and after the term of this Agreement, each party will and will cause its officers, employees, contractors and agents to keep secret and confidential all Confidential Information of the other and will not copy, use or disclose any such information to any third party, other than as may be necessary to comply with its obligations under this Agreement; provided that a party may disclose the other party's Confidential Information to Affiliates.</li>

Such interest will accrue at the annual rate of 2% above the base rate of the Bank of England in force from the due date until the date of payment, or the highest rate allowable by applicable law (if lower).  Interest will accrue on a daily basis, whether before or after judgement.</li>
