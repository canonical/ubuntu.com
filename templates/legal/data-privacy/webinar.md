# Privacy notice – Webinars

This privacy notice tells you about the information collected from you when you sign up to watch one of our webinars. The webinar may be hosted on a third party website and the third party webinar platform provider may direct you to their website to register your details in order to watch a Canonical webinar. In collecting this information, the third party webinar platform provider are acting as a data controller and data collection may be subject to their privacy policy. The third party webinar platform provider will be sharing your data with us and by law, we are required to provide you with information about us, about why and how we use your data, and about the rights you have over your data.

## Who are we?

We are Canonical Group Limited. Our address is 5 New Street Square, London, EC4A 3TW, United Kingdom. You can contact us by post at the address set out in the "right to complain" section, below or by email to [dataprotection@canonical.com](mailto:dataprotection@canonical.com) for the attention of "Legal".

We are not required to have a data protection officer, so any enquiries about our use of your personal data should be addressed to the contact details above.

## What personal data do we collect?

When you sign up to watch one of our webinars, the third party webinar platform provider may ask you for your name and your email address and related information. They will share this information with us.

## Why do we collect this information?

Your information will be used by us to conduct existing and future research of Canonical's products and services.

Where you have agreed on the third party webinar platform provider's website, we will use your information to send you other news and product updates from Canonical. This may involve us calling you, where we have your phone number in order to do so.

Consent is requested to do this, and we will only send you or tell you about news and product updates for as long as you continue to consent.

## What do we do with your information?

Your information is stored in our database and is not shared with any third parties, except as reasonably required for Canonical to process and store your data. It is sent outside of the European Economic Area for our own internal processing purposes only.

## How long do we keep your information for?

We keep your information for so long as reasonably required in accordance with our record retention policy. Where you have agreed, your information is kept for as long as you continue to consent to receive our news and product updates.

## Your rights over your information

By law, you can ask us what information we hold about you, and you can ask us to correct it if it is inaccurate.

You can also ask for it to be erased and you can ask for us to give you a copy of the information.

You can also ask us to stop using your information for news or product updates – the simplest way to do this is to withdraw your consent, which you can do at any time, either by clicking the unsubscribe link at the end of any email, or by emailing, writing or telephoning us using the contact details above.

## Email marketing communications

Canonical offers a free email newsletter subscription service to keep you informed of our products and services. You may receive these marketing communications from us. We incorporate a tracking system in our email marketing communications which allows us to monitor whether the email has been opened and which links are the most popular. This allows us to tailor and refine our service to ensure that the emails you receive are relevant to your interests.

Where you have consented to receiving email marketing material from us or are currently receiving material relating to similar products or services, you may at any time ask us to cease sending you such material by (i) clicking the unsubscribe button at the end of the email, (ii) reply to the email with “STOP”,  (iii) sending an email to [dataprotection@canonical.com](mailto:dataprotection@canonical.com), or (iv) navigating to your subscription centre page (you will need to login if you have not already done so) and click the 'unsubscribe' link at the foot of the page as appropriate. 

## Links to other websites

The third party webinar platform provider site may contain links to other third party websites with whom we have a relationship. However, we are not responsible for these websites and their privacy practices. We therefore suggest that you read the privacy policy statements on any website that you visit from a link on this site, as their policies and procedures may differ from our own.

## Keeping your personal information secure

We have appropriate security measures in place to prevent personal information from being accidentally lost, or used or accessed in an unauthorised way. We limit access to your personal information to those who have a genuine business need to know it. Those processing your information will do so only in an authorised manner and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data breach where we are legally required to do so.

## Changes to this Privacy Notice

This Privacy Notice will be reviewed from time to time. If we decide to change this Privacy Notice we will post the changes here. However, if we intend to make material changes to the way we use your personal information we will notify you before doing so. Any personal information held will be governed by our most current notice.
