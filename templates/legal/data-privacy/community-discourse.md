# Privacy notice – Ubuntu Community Discourse

This privacy notice tells you about the information collected from you when you register for an Ubuntu Community Discourse account.

## Why do we collect this information?

Your information will be used by us for the provision of services in the creation of an Ubuntu Community Discourse account. The Ubuntu Community Discourse account is then used to access the Ubuntu Community Discourse forum.
