      <h2 id="why-we-use-your-information">4. Why we use your information</h2>

      <p>We use your personal information as part of the recruitment process at Canonical. Using your information allows us to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Carry out recruitment operations,</li>
        <li>Assess your skills, qualifications, and suitability for the role,</li>

      <p>We use your information because we believe we have a legitimate business interest in managing our recruitment operations and enabling the hiring of new employees for our organisation. We also process your personal information to decide whether to enter a contract of employment with you.</p>

      <p>Having received your application via the recruitment platform Greenhouse, we will process your information to decide whether you meet the requirements for the role. If your application progresses to the next stage, we may send you further communications regarding psychometric testing and interviews. We will use the information you provide during any testing and interviews to determine your suitability for the role that you are applying for.</p>

      <h2 id="who-we-share-your-information-with">5. Who we share your information with</h2>

      <p>We only share your personal information for the purposes of facilitating the recruitment process. To achieve this, we may share your information amongst other international Canonical group entities and third-party companies providing services to us. Your personal information may be:</p>

      <p><b>Transferred to other international Canonical group entities</b></p>
      
      <p>We may share your personal information with other Canonical group entities where necessary for HR, recruitment, administrative and support services. Further information on international transfers has been included in Section 6. International Data Transfers below.</p>

      <p><b>Transferred to third-party organisations that provide services to us</b></p>
      
      <p>We use third-party service providers that support us in operating our recruitment processes, including application management and psychometric testing platforms. We may also ask for feedback on the recruitment process. These third-party service providers are listed below:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Greenhouse Software, Inc.</li>
        <li>ClassMarker Pty Ltd.</li>
        <li>Thomas International Ltd.</li>
        <li>Talenthub.io</li>
        <li>Devskiller S.A</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We also use third party service providers who help facilitate, run and manage our internal administrative systems. For example, we use service providers for scheduling and conducting interviews, data storage and back-up services.</p>

      <p><b>Transferred to government agencies and/or regulators</b></p>
      
      <p>We may also transfer your personal information to government agencies or regulators as required to comply with our legal obligations.</p>
      
      <p>Where we share your data with third parties, we implement appropriate legal mechanisms and security measures to ensure the protection of your personal information.</p>

      <h2 id="international-data-transfers">6. International data transfers</h2>

      <p>As Canonical is an international organisation, we may process, transfer and store your personal information outside the UK and European Economic Area (“EEA”).</p>

      <p>Where your personal information is transferred to international Canonical entities and third parties outside the UK and EEA, we will always undertake reasonable steps to ensure that adequate security mechanisms are implemented to protect your information to the same standard as within the UK and EEA, allowing you to exercise the same rights over your data. To ensure that the data protection policies of the receiving organisations meet the UK and EEA regulatory standards, we use approved standard contractual clauses to protect your personal information.</p>

      <h2 id="how-we-protect-your-information">7. How we protect your information</h2>

      <p>We take the security of your personal information seriously, and have implemented appropriate security measures, internal policies and controls to prevent your information from being lost, misused, accessed without authorisation, altered or accidentally destroyed. Our security policy includes systems restrictions, encrypted and password protected files, retention protocols and security training for management.</p>

      <p>In addition, we use strict access controls to ensure that your information is only accessible on a need-to-know basis, by employees who are directly involved in your recruitment application. Any third parties that process your information act on our instructions and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>

      <h2 id="how-long-we-keep-your-information">8. How long we keep your information</h2>

      <p>We keep your personal information for a period of 2 years, after your recruitment application is decided. We keep your information for that period in order to respond to or defend against any legal claims. After this period, we will securely delete or anonymise your personal information, in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. When we anonymise your information, this makes it unidentifiable as to whom it originally belonged to.</p>

      <p>If you are unsuccessful with your application, we may also keep your information in case there are any similar opportunities that may be suitable for you in the future. In any event, we will not hold your data for more than 2 years.</p>

      <p>If you do not want us to keep your information after the recruitment process has ended, please contact us at <a href="mailto:dataprotection@canonical.com">dataprotection@canonical.com</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="automated-decision-making">9. Automated decision-making</h2>
