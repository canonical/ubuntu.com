      <h2 id="information-we-collect-from-you">Information we collect from you</h2>
      <ul class="p-list">
        <li class="p-list__item"><strong>Information you give us</strong>. This is information about you that you give us by filling in forms on a Canonical website or by corresponding with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise. It includes information you provide when you register to use our site, your login information where provided on a site or make a purchase on our site. It may include the following: first name, last name; company name; company size; industry; job title; level; phone number; email address; state or province and country.</li>
        <li><strong>Information about your visit</strong>. This information includes the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL), clickstream to, through and from our site (including date and time, timezone, your geolocation), items you viewed or searched for, page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), methods used to browse away from the page.</li>
        <li><strong>Information we receive from other sources</strong>. This is information we receive about you if you use any of the other websites we operate or the other services we provide. In this case we will have informed you when we collected that data (through a Privacy notice) if we intend to share those data internally and combine it with data collected on this site. We will also have told you for what purpose we will share and combine your data. We are working closely with third parties (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, credit reference agencies). We may notify you when we receive information about you from them and the purposes for which we intend to use that information.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="how-information-is-collected-from-you">How information is collected from you</h2>
      <p>We may collect this information through the following routes:</p>
      <h3>Websites</h3>
      <p>When you register to use certain parts of our websites, such as wikis, webinars or message boards, or register for free accounts, we may ask for personal information such as your full name, email address and a password. Please see the Privacy notice on collection for further details of how we will use your personal data.</p>
      <h3>Chat rooms, forums and newsgroups</h3>
      <p>These are available to our community. Any information that you disclose in these areas becomes public information and may be recorded, archived and republished by anyone. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information in such areas.</p>
      <h3>Canonical products</h3>
      <p>When you register for services or purchase any product from Canonical, we may ask for information such as your email address, billing address, and credit card information. Credit card information is only used in processing your transaction. Please note that we may use a third party payment processing merchant to process your payments. Please see the terms and conditions of purchase and/or relevant Privacy notice for further information.</p>
      <h3>Webinars</h3>
      <p>Some webinars are directly hosted by Canonical on our sites. Where a webinar is operated by a third-party provider, you will be directed to a third-party website and the third-party provider may collect information as part of the webinar registration process. This data will be collected in accordance with the third-party provider's terms and conditions. Please see "Links and third-party content" in the Terms and Conditions for further details.</p>
      <h3>Non-personally identifying information</h3>
      <p>Canonical may collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use our websites and services. For further information about how we use cookies, see the "cookie" section below.</p>
      <p>Please note that Canonical may also collect system information during installation of Ubuntu and on first login to Ubuntu. This system information is subject to a <a href="/legal/online-account-terms">Legal Notice</a>.</p>
      <h3>Error reports</h3>
      <p>When you chose to send an error report, it includes a unique identifier for your computer. This identifier does not identify you, unless you (or someone acting on your behalf) discloses it separately. An error report may include personal information such as the state of programs that were running at the time. You can block future error reports from the privacy panel of System Settings or by deselecting the "Enable Google Analytics in MAAS UI to shape improvements in user experience" box where applicable.</p>
      <h3>Ubuntu online accounts</h3>
      <p>When you use Ubuntu online accounts, your personal information is stored on your PC and it can be accessed by some applications. Further information can be found in a <a href="/legal/online-account-terms">Legal Notice</a>.</p>
      <h3>Contacting us</h3>
      <p>If you contact us and provide us with information, we may keep a record of that correspondence and information.</p>
      <h2 id="what-do-we-do-with-your-personal-data">What do we do with your personal data</h2>
      <p>We may use your information in the following ways:</p>
      <ul class="p-list--divided">
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">To authenticate access to certain features of our websites.</li>
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">To contact you to respond to enquiries or to provide notices to you regarding your use of our websites or the provision of our services.</li>
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">To provide services, products, process payment, and authenticate access (where required).</li>
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">To analyse the performance or the appropriateness of products or services.</li>
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">To comply with legal and regulatory requirements (including responding to court orders, subpoenas and to prevent crime). These special circumstances may require us to disclose personal information.</li>
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">To contact you if your actions violate your agreement with us (if any).</li>
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">To fix errors and analyse trends.</li>
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">To study how anonymous users interact with our websites and services.</li>
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">To market our products or services to you.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Unless you have notified us otherwise, Canonical may occasionally send you email to tell you about new features, solicit feedback, or just to keep you up to date with what's going on. We may use various community websites (Launchpad Answers, Ubuntu Forums, blogs etc.) to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of information to a minimum. If you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications, modify the communications preferences in your account or contact us using the contact details provided below.</p>
      <h2 id="what-are-your-rights">What are your rights?</h2>
      <p>You have the right to consent to our processing of personal data for marketing purposes and to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data.</p>
      <p>You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:dataprotection@canonical.com">dataprotection@canonical.com</a> or by using the relevant <a href="/contact-us">contact us</a> form.</p>
      <p>Under the data protection legislation, you have the following rights. These consist of:</p>
      <ul class="p-list--divided">
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">The right to be informed</li>
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">The right of access</li>
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">The right to rectification</li>
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">The right to erasure</li>
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">The right to restrict processing</li>
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">The right to data portability</li>
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">The right to object</li>
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each of these rights are supported by appropriate procedures within Canonical which allow the required action to be taken within the timescales stated in the applicable data protection legislation.</p>
      <p>You can also ask us to stop using your information – the simplest way to do this is to withdraw your consent, which you can do at any time, either by clicking the unsubscribe link at the end of any newsletter, or by emailing, writing or telephoning us using the contact details above.</p>
      <p>We keep your order information for so long as reasonably required in accordance with our record retention policy. Your personal information associated with the order will then be removed.</p>
      <p>Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.</p>
