# Privacy notice - Online purchase

This privacy notice tells you about the information we collect from you when you purchase one or more of our products via our website. In collecting this information, we are acting as a data controller and, by law, we are required to provide you with information about us, about why and how we use your data, and about the rights you have over your data. For more information, please see our [privacy policy](/legal/data-privacy).

## Who are we?

We are Canonical Group Limited. Our address is The Office Group, St Dunstans House, 4th floor, 201 Borough High St, London SE1 1JA. You can contact us by post at the above address or by email to [dataprotection@canonical.com](mailto:dataprotection@canonical.com) for the attention of "Legal".

We are not required to have a data protection officer, so any enquiries about our use of your personal data should be addressed to the contact details above.

## What personal data do we collect?

When you purchase products from us online, we ask you for your name, address, contact telephone number, email address and credit card information.

## Why do we collect this information?

Your information will be used by our third party payment provider to verify your credit card details for your purchase and for Canonical or our third party supplier to process your order and to send you your goods. We will also send you a receipt via email and we (or the third party supplier) may use your telephone number to contact you regarding your delivery.

We require this information in order to process your payment, deliver your goods and fulfil our contract with you.

## What do we do with your information?

Your information is stored in our database and may be processed outside of the European Economic Area. 

Such countries do not have the same data protection laws as the United Kingdom and EEA. Where the European Commission has not given a formal decision that such countries provide an adequate level of data protection, any transfer of your personal information will be subject to approved contract terms designed to help safeguard your privacy rights and give you remedies in the unlikely event of misuse of your personal information. If you would like further information please contact us (see "Your right to complain" below).  It is shared with the third parties set out below and as reasonably required for Canonical to process and store your data.

Your credit card details are passed to a third-party payment processor who retains credit card details.

Our third-party payment processor is a company called Stripe Payments Europe, Limited, who we use to process and confirm your payments. We share with them your name, address and credit card information only for payment purposes. We do not retain credit card data but our payment service providers do. For your safety, we have in place agreement between us to protect, safeguard your information and prohibit any sharing for any reasons whatsoever.

We also use a third-party supplier called Shopify Inc. to provision your order and we share with them your name, address and telephone number in order to complete the delivery.

## Our legal basis to use your Personal information

## Email marketing communications

Canonical offers a free email newsletter subscription service to keep you informed of our products and services. You may receive these marketing communications from us. We incorporate a tracking system in our email marketing communications which allows us to monitor whether the email has been opened and which links are the most popular. This allows us to tailor and refine our service to ensure that the emails you receive are relevant to your interests.

Where you have consented to receiving email marketing material from us or are currently receiving material relating to similar products or services, you may at any time ask us to cease sending you such material by (i) clicking the unsubscribe button at the end of the email, (ii) reply to the email with "STOP",  (iii) sending an email to [dataprotection@canonical.com](mailto:dataprotection@canonical.com), or (iv) navigating to your subscription centre page (you will need to login if you have not already done so) and click the 'unsubscribe' link at the foot of the page as appropriate. 

## Links to other websites

The purchased products may contain links to other third party websites with whom we have a relationship. However, we are not responsible for these websites and their privacy practices. We therefore suggest that you read the privacy policy statements on any website that you visit from a link on this site, as their policies and procedures may differ from our own.

## Keeping your personal information secure

We have appropriate security measures in place to prevent personal information from being accidentally lost, or used or accessed in an unauthorised way. We limit access to your personal information to those who have a genuine business need to know it. Those processing your information will do so only in an authorised manner and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data breach where we are legally required to do so.

## Changes to this Privacy Notice

This Privacy Notice will be reviewed from time to time. If we decide to change this Privacy Notice we will post the changes here. However, if we intend to make material changes to the way we use your personal information we will notify you before doing so. Any personal information held will be governed by our most current notice.
