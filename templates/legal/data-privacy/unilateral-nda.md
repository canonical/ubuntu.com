# Privacy Notice – Confidentiality agreement

This privacy notice tells you about the information we collect from you when you submit your information to us via the confidentiality agreement form on our website. In collecting this information, we are acting as a data controller and, by law, we are required to provide you with information about us, about why and how we use your data, and about the rights you have over your data. For more information, please see our [privacy policy](/legal/data-privacy).

## Who are we?

We are Canonical Group Limited. Our address is 5 New Street Square, London, EC4A 3TW, United Kingdom. You can contact us by post at the address set out in the “right to complain” section, below or by email to <a href="mailto:dataprotection@canonical.com">dataprotection@canonical.com</a> for the attention of "Legal".

We are not required to have a data protection officer, so any enquiries about our use of your personal data should be addressed to the contact details above.

## What personal data do we collect?

When you submit your information to us using the confidentiality agreement form we ask you for your name, your address, your organisation name and title, if applicable and related information.

## Why do we collect this information?

By signing the confidentiality agreement you are entering into a legally binding agreement. We will use your information to fully execute the confidentiality agreement.

We ask for your consent to do this, and we will only contact you in relation to the confidentiality agreement for the duration of the term of the confidentiality agreement.

## What do we do with your information?

Your information is stored in our database and is not shared with any third parties, except as reasonably required for Canonical to process and store your data. It is sent outside of the European Economic Area for our own internal processing purposes only.

## How long do we keep your information for?

Your information is kept for the term of the confidentiality agreement and for so long as reasonably required thereafter in accordance with our record retention policy.

## Your rights over your information

By law, you can ask us what information we hold about you, and you can ask us to correct it if it is inaccurate.

You can also ask for it to be erased and you can ask for us to give you a copy of the information.

You can also ask us to stop using your information for newsletters, news or product updates – the simplest way to do this is to withdraw your consent, which you can do at any time, either by clicking the unsubscribe link at the end of any newsletter or email, or by emailing, writing or telephoning us using the contact details above.

## Your right to complain

If you have a complaint about our use of your information, you can contact the Information Commissioner's Office via their website at <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint">ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint</a> or write to them at:
