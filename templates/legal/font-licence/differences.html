<del>SIL OPEN</del> <ins>UBUNTU</ins> FONT LICEN<u>C</u>E Version <ins>1.0</ins> <del>1.1 - 26 February 2007</del>
---------------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
<del>The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.</del>

<ins><span class="moved">Th</span>is licence</ins> <del><span class="moved">Th</span>e OFL</del> allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified
and redistributed freely <del>as long as they are not sold by themselves</del>. The fonts,
including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, <ins class="moved">and</ins> redistributed
<del><span class="moved">and</span>/or sold with any software</del> provided <ins>the terms of this licence are met</ins>
<del>that any reserved names are not used by derivative works</del>. The fonts and
derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other <del>type of</del> licen<u>c</u>e.
The requirement for fonts to remain under this licen<u>c</u>e does not <ins>require</ins>
<del>apply to</del> any document created using the fonts or their derivatives
<ins>to be published under this licence, as long as the primary purpose of
the document is not to be a vehicle for the distribution of the fonts</ins>.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this licen<u>c</u>e and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

<del>"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).</del>

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components
as <ins>received under this licence</ins> <del>distributed by the Copyright Holder(s)</del>.

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to
a new environment.

"<del>Author</del> <ins>Copyright Holder(s)</ins>" refers to <ins>all individuals and companies
<span class="moved">who</span> have a copyright ownership of</ins> <del>any designer, engineer, programmer,
technical writer or other person <span class="moved">who</span> contributed to</del> the Font Software.

<ins>"Substantially Changed" refers to Modified Versions which can be easily
identified as dissimilar to the Font Software by users of the Font
Software comparing the Original Version with the Modified Version.

To "Propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification and with or without charging
a redistribution fee), making available to the public, and in some
countries other activities as well.</ins>

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
<ins>This licence does not grant any rights under trademark law and all such
rights are reserved.</ins>

copy of the Font Software, to <del>use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,

<u>E</u>ach copy <ins><span class="moved">of the Font Software</span> must</ins> contain<del>s</del> the above copyright
notice and this licen<u>c</u>e. These can be included either as stand-alone
text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-
readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those
fields can be easily viewed by the user.

<ins>2<span class="moved">)</span> T<span class="moved">he font name</span> complies with <span class="moved">the</span> following:
(a) The Original Version must retain its name, unmodified.
(b) <span class="moved">Modified Version</span>s which are Substantially Changed must be renamed to

(c) <span class="moved">Modified Version</span>s which are not Substantially Changed must be
renamed to both (i) retain the name of <span class="moved">the</span> Original Version and (ii) add
additional naming elements to distinguish the <span class="moved">Modified Version</span> from the
Original Version. T<span class="moved">he name</span> of such <span class="moved">Modified Version</span>s must be <span class="moved">the name</span> of
the Original Version, with "derivative X" where X re<span class="moved">present</span>s <span class="moved">the name</span> of
