        <p>Following the Beta period, payment for the Service is due at the time of the next use of the Service in a new environment.</p>
        <p>You will be asked to enter your credit card details once the Beta period has ended and to confirm your acceptance of the Terms of Service. We will only charge your credit card at the time of the use of the Service after the Beta. Fees are charged
          in the currency in which you make your purchase. The Fees will be displayed on your account page, including payment details.</p>

          is placed on your account page or as otherwise stated. If you do not wish to pay the increased price, you may cancel your use of the Service in the manner described in <a href="#end-of-service">Section 4</a> above and you will not be charged
          further amounts for your use of the Service, provided you have notified us before the end of the current billing period. If your use of the Service is cancelled and you later decide to renew the Service, you will initially be charged at the
          then current price.
        </p>
        <p>You are responsible for any Taxes (as defined below), and must pay for the Service without any reduction for Taxes. If Canonical is obliged to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be charged to you. If you have a VAT ID please provide this with
