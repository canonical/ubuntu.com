        <p>Following the Beta period, payment for the Service is due at the time of the next use of the Service in a new environment.</p>

          in the currency in which you make your purchase. The Fees will be displayed on your account page, including payment details.</p>

          is placed on your account page or as otherwise stated. If you do not wish to pay the increased price, you may cancel your use of the Service in the manner described in <a href="#end-of-service">Section 4</a> above and you will not be charged
          further amounts for your use of the Service, provided you have notified us before the end of the current billing period. If your use of the Service is cancelled and you later decide to renew the Service, you will initially be charged at the
          then current price.
        </p>
