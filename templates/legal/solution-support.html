      <h1>Solution Support</h1>
      <p>As a support customer covered by the services set out herein, you are entitled to the benefits and services as further described below. </p>
      <h2>Support Levels</h2>
      <p>As Standard or Advanced customer, you are entitled to the following benefits and services:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>24x5 (Standard) or 24x7 (Advanced) phone and ticket support.</li>
        <li>Releases. Canonical will provide support for installation, configuration, maintenance, use and management of any LTS release of the Solution when installed using official sources and within its product life cycle. The life cycle for each LTS version of the Solution will be specified on the Solution provider’s website.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Support Services Process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Service Initiation:
          <ol>
            <li>Upon commencement of the services, Canonical will provide access to the support portal and the online knowledge base (if any).</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Submitting Support Requests:
          <ol>
            <li>The customer may open a support request once the customer account has been provisioned within the support portal.</li>
            <li>The customer may submit support cases through the support portal or by contacting the support team by telephone, unless otherwise noted.</li>
            <li>A support case should consist of a single discrete problem, issue, or request.</li>
            <li>Cases are assigned a ticket number and responded to automatically. All correspondence not entered directly into the case, including emails and telephone calls, will be logged into the case with a timestamp for quality assurance.</li>
            <li>When reporting a case, the customer should provide an impact statement to help Canonical determine the appropriate severity level. Customers with multiple concurrent support cases may be asked to prioritise cases according to severity of business impact.</li>
            <li>The customer is expected to provide all information requested by Canonical as we work to resolve the case.</li>
            <li>Canonical will keep a record of each case within the support portal enabling the customer to track and respond to all current cases and allowing for review of historical cases.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Support Severity Levels:
          <ol>
            <li>Once a support request is opened, a Canonical Support Engineer will validate the case information and determine the severity level, working with the customer to assess the urgency of the case.</li>
            <li>Response times will be as set forth in the Service Description for the applicable service offering.</li>
            <li>When setting the severity level, Canonical's Support Team will use the definitions as stated below:
              <table>
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Severity Level 1<br>Core functionality not available</th>
                    <td>Canonical will use continuous effort according to the service level purchased, through appropriate support engineer(s) and/or development engineer(s), to provide a work-around or permanent solution. As soon as core functionality is available, the severity level will be lowered to the new appropriate severity level. Where Canonical’s required solution is to move to a later LTS, the severity level will be lowered to a new appropriate severity level if you decide not to move to such LTS.</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Severity Level 2<br>Core functionality severely degraded</th>
                    <td>Canonical will provide concerted efforts during the applicable business hours to provide the customer with a work-around or permanent solution. As soon as core functionality is no longer severely degraded, the severity level will be lowered to level 3. As above, where Canonical’s required solution is to move to a later LTS, the severity level will be lowered to a new appropriate severity level if you decide not to move to such LTS.</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Severity Level 3<br>Standard support request</th>
                    <td>Canonical will use reasonable efforts during the applicable business hours to provide the customer with a work-around or permanent solution as soon as possible, balanced against higher severity level cases. If a work-around is provided, Canonical's support engineers will continue to work on developing a permanent resolution to the case.</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Severity Level 4<br>Non-urgent request</th>
                    <td>Level 4 requests include cosmetic issues, informational requests, feature requests, and similar matters. Canonical does not provide a timeline or guarantee for inclusion of any feature requests. Canonical will review each level 4 case and determine whether it is a product enhancement to be considered for a future release, an issue to be fixed in the current release or an issue to be fixed in a future release. Canonical will review and respond to information requests with a reasonable level of effort during coverage hours. Canonical may close cases representing level 4 issues after responding if Canonical believes it is appropriate to do so.</td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Response times. Canonical will use reasonable efforts to respond to support requests made by the customer within the response times set forth below, based on the applicable service and severity level.<br>
