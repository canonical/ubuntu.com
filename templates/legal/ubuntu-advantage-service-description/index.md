The customer will receive up to 5 dedicated, personalised credentials for technical representatives per every 500 Nodes under UA support, but not more than a total of 15 credentials
    3. The customer may change their specified technical representatives at any time by submitting a support request via the support portal
2. Submitting support requests
    4. The customer may open a support request once the customer account has been provisioned within the support portal
    5. The customer may submit support cases through the support portal or by contacting the support team by telephone, unless otherwise noted
    6. A support case should consist of a single discrete problem, issue, or request
    7. Cases are assigned a ticket number and responded to automatically. All correspondence not entered directly into the case, including emails and telephone calls, will be logged into the case with a timestamp for quality assurance
    8. When reporting a case, the customer should provide an impact statement to help Canonical determine the appropriate severity level. Customers with multiple concurrent support cases may be asked to prioritize cases according to severity of business impact
    9. The customer is expected to provide all information requested by Canonical as we work to resolve the case
    10. Canonical will keep a record of each case within the support portal enabling the customer to track and respond to all current cases and allowing for review of historical cases
3. Support severity levels
    11. Once a support request is opened, a Canonical support engineer will validate the case information and determine the severity level, working with the customer to assess the urgency of the case
    12. Canonical will work 24/7 or during the applicable Business Hours as described below to provide the customer with a work-around or permanent solution following the severity levels as described below.  As soon as core functionality is available, the severity level will be lowered to the new appropriate severity level.
    13. Canonical will use reasonable efforts to respond to support requests made by the customer within the initial response times set forth below, based on the applicable service and severity level, but cannot guarantee a work-around, resolution or resolution time:

4. Customer assistance. Continuous effort support is dependent on the customer being available at all times to assist Canonical, otherwise Canonical may need to reduce the severity level and its ability to respond
5. Hotfixes. To temporarily resolve critical support cases, Canonical may provide a version of the affected software (e.g. package) that applies a patch. Such versions are referred to as “hotfixes”. Hotfixes provided by Canonical are supported for 90 days after the corresponding patch has been incorporated into a release of the software in the Ubuntu Archives. However, if a patch is rejected by the applicable upstream project, the hotfix will no longer be supported and the case will remain open
6. Support language. Canonical will provide the support in English, unless specified otherwise
7. Remote sessions. At the discretion of a Canonical engineer, a remote access service might be offered to access a supported system. In such a case, Canonical will determine which remote access service to use. Canonical engineers do not perform any remote actions on a supported system
8. Ask for a Peer Review. As a normal business practice, Canonical performs peer reviews on a percentage of all cases. Customers can specifically request a peer review on a case within the case comments or by calling the phone number listed in the support portal. An impartial engineer will be assigned to review the case and provide feedback
9. Management escalation. The customer may escalate support issues following the escalation process:
    14. Non-urgent needs. Request a management escalation within the case itself. A manager will be contacted to review the case and post a response within 1 business day
    15. Urgent needs can be escalated to Canonical's Support & Technical Services Manager by emailing [support-manager@canonical.com](mailto:support-manager@canonical.com). If you require further escalation, email Canonical's Support & Technical Services Director at [operations-director@canonical.com](mailto:operations-director@canonical.com)

<h2 id="embedded-services">Embedded Services</h2>

Where services are denoted to be “Embedded” the following applies: 

1. <u>Introduction</u>. You will receive the engineering support and access to Extended Security Maintenance. Canonical will provide such technical support to unmodified Ubuntu LTS release images when installed using official sources and within its [product life cycle](https://www.ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle)
2. <u>Scope</u>. The scope of the service is limited to the appropriate level: UA Infra, UA Apps or Ubuntu Pro offerings, as listed above
3. <u>Engineering Support-only: scope and process</u>.
    You will provide the following:
    1. You are responsible for resolving all end user issues. Canonical will not be supporting end-users directly. You should utilise the Knowledge Base, Launchpad, and other resources in addition to your own resolution systems to find workarounds or resolutions for any issue prior to opening a support case with Canonical
    2. You will search Launchpad, to ensure that the issue is not already known and being resolved and, if it is, provide suspected bug number to Canonical support as reference. Canonical reserves the right to redirect low-level and untriaged issues to you
    3. You are responsible for specifying how an issue arises and in what sub-system it is taking place. You must provide a repeatable test case that Canonical can recreate on the hardware systems to which Canonical has access
    4. You will work with Canonical to provide any debugging or further testing required. You will provide any technical information as requested to resolve the problem. Failure to provide required information or assistance in gathering such information may result in closure of the case. When the final solution has been provided by Canonical, you are responsible for verifying that it solves the issue

Or Managed Applications as described in the Add-ons section, under Managed Services, and at [https://ubuntu.com/managed](https://ubuntu.com/managed). The list of Applications are subject to change without notice

**Break-fix Support**: assistance in the event of an error or bug and answering basic questions about Supported Packages and Standard Releases of Ubuntu

**Bug-fix Support**: support for valid code bugs in supported packages only. This does not include troubleshooting of issues to determine if a bug is present

**Business Hours:** 08:00&ndash;18:00, Monday&ndash;Friday, local to the customer's headquarters unless another location is agreed. All times exclude public holidays

**Ceph Cluster**: a single Ceph installation in a single physical data center and specified by a unique identifier

**Charm:** a set of scripts compatible with Juju application modelling for the purpose of deploying and configuring relationships between software packages

**Charmed Kubernetes:** Kubernetes deployed using Juju and the official Canonical-Kubernetes bundle on bare metal, Cloud Guests, or virtual machines

**Cloud Guest**: a Guest Instance or Container Instance of Ubuntu Server

**Container Instance: **a container instance running in the cluster

**Covered Hypervisor:** any of: KVM | Qemu | Boch, VMWare ESXi, LXD | LXC, Xen, Hyper-V, VirtualBox, z/VM, Docker, WSL. All Nodes in the cluster have to be subscribed to the service in order to benefit from the unlimited VM support

**CVEs (High and Critical):** High and Critical Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures as assessed by the Ubuntu Security Team. More details can be found at https://ubuntu.com/security/cves

**DSE:** a Canonical dedicated support engineer assigned to work full-time for a single customer acting as an extension of the customer's support organisation with a primary focus on integrating and supporting Canonicals offerings within the customer's Environment

**DTAM:** a Canonical support engineer dedicated to work full-time remotely for a single customer

**Environment**: a cloud or cluster, as applicable to the particular service offering

**End of Life: **a date (10 years after the Release Date) on which the Extended Security Maintenance service for an Ubuntu LTS expires

**End of Standard Support: **a date (5 years after the Release Date) on which free standard security maintenance service for the Ubuntu Main repository of an Ubuntu LTS expires

**Extended Security Maintenance (ESM): **an additional scope of security patching service delivered by the Ubuntu Security Team as found at https://ubuntu.com/security/esm. It covers fixes to High and Critical CVE vulnerabilities for 10 years

**Full Stack Support**: addressing problems pertaining to user and operations-level functionality, performance and availability

**Guest Instance**: a virtual machine instance

**Kubernetes**: the container orchestration software known as “Kubernetes” as distributed by Canonical
