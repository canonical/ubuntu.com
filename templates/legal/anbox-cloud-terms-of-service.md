# Terms of service

## 1\. Introduction

These Terms of Service cover your access to the Anbox Cloud Demo Service ("**Anbox Cloud Demo**") made available by Canonical Group Limited ("**Canonical**", "**us**", "**our**" or "**we**") to you ("**you**" or "**your**") subject to and in accordance with these Terms of Service (the "**Service**").

Please read these Terms of Service carefully before you use the Services. By using Services, you agree to become bound by these Terms of Service. You may not use the Service for illegal or unauthorised purposes or otherwise in accordance with these Terms of Service.

If you are entering into these Terms of Service on behalf of a company or legal entity, you represent that you have authority to bind such company or legal entity, its officers, employees and agents and all users who access the Service through the account, to these Terms of Service. "you" and "your" shall refer to the company or legal entity and such users. If you do not have such authority do not accept these Terms of Service.

You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. If you are between age 13 and 18, we require your parent's or legal guardian's consent to use of the Services, please contact us at legal@canonical.com.

Any change or update to the Services or Terms of Service will be made in accordance with section 6 below.

## 2\. Services

The Service enables you to access a demo of Anbox Cloud ([https://anbox-cloud.io](https://anbox-cloud.io)) which includes streaming an Android system from the cloud.

## 3\. Account

You will need an account to access and use the Service. We reserve the right to reject your request for an account or to immediately cancel or suspend your account and your use of the Services at any time if you do not comply with the following requirements. You must not attempt to create an account or use the Service if doing so would violate these Terms of Service. You must:

- have a Service account
- not use the Service for illegal or unauthorised purposes (or which encourage or permit illegal or authorised purposes), in infringement of a third party's' rights or otherwise in accordance with these Terms of Service
- not take any action or use the Service in any way that might bring Canonical into disrepute or affect the ability of Canonical to provide the Service
- not use the Service in any manner that might be libellous or defamatory, that contains threats or incites violence towards individuals or entities, or that violates the privacy rights of any third party
- not be located in or use the Services in an OFAC/EAR embargoed or sanctioned country or be on the U.S. Commerce Department's Denied Persons List, Entity List, or Unverified List

In order to access the Anbox Cloud Demo you will require an invitation code and a Single Sign On account with Canonical. The invitation code in conjunction with your Single Sign On account will create an Anbox Cloud Demo account which will enable you to access the Anbox Cloud Demo.

## 4\. End of Service

We look forward to providing you with the Service for a limited trial period only. The trial period will be specified on the invitation code and may differ from user to user. However, there are also some circumstances under which the Service may be suspended or terminated:

- We cease to make the Service (or any part thereof) available
- By us at any time as described in Section 3 above

We may also cease to offer the Services for any other reason, in which case we will provide you with notice on your account page.

## 6\. Changes

We aim to continually improve the delivery and content of the Service and accordingly may make changes to the Service throughout the trial.

This Service is offered on a trial basis, and your use of this Service will be limited to the period of your trial. New features may be added, but we may also modify or discontinue (temporarily or permanently) part of the Service, in part or in whole before the end of the trial period.

In the event of a material change to the Service, we will notify you on your account page. What constitutes a material change in this circumstance will be determined by Canonical, in good faith and using common sense and reasonable judgment.

Similarly, we may occasionally make changes to these Terms of Service and will notify you of material changes either by email or on your account page. If Canonical does make changes to these Terms of Service, all changes will go into effect at the time we post the updated Terms of Service on your account page or as otherwise notified at that time.

## 7\. Intellectual property

You have a non-exclusive, non-transferable (to the extent permitted by law) right to view, access and use the Services for such time as it is made available by us strictly in accordance with these Terms of Service.

You will not acquire any rights to the Service (or the intellectual property rights contained therein) from your use of the Service, other than as set out in these Terms of Service.

## 8\. Personal data
