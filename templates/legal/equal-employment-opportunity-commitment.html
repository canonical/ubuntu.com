      <h1>Canonical Equal Employment Opportunity Commitment</h1>

      <p class="p-text--small">In compliance with USA Code: 41 C.F.R. §§ 60-300.44(a); 60-741.44(a)</p>

      <p>It is the policy of Canonical USA Inc. (the  “Company”) to provide equal employment opportunity to all employees and applicants without regard to race, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, physical or mental disability, status as a protected veteran, or any other characteristics protected by law.  This policy governs all terms and conditions of employment, including recruiting, hiring, training, promotion, demotion, transfer, layoff, compensation, discipline, and termination.</p>

      <p>Employees and applicants of the Company will not be subject to harassment on the basis of their race, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, physical or mental disability, status as a protected veteran, or any other characteristics protected by law.  The Company will not discharge or in any other manner discriminate against employees or applicants because they have inquired about, discussed, or disclosed their own pay or the pay of another employee or applicant.  However, employees who have access to the compensation information of other employees or applicants as part of their essential job functions cannot disclose the pay of other employees or applicants to individuals who do not otherwise have access to compensation information, unless the disclosure is (a) in response to a formal complaint or charge, (b) in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action, including an investigation conducted by the Company, or (c) consistent with the Company's legal duty to furnish information.  Furthermore, the Company will make reasonable accommodations for qualified protected veterans and individuals with known disabilities unless doing so would result in an undue hardship or a direct threat to safety.</p>

      <p>Retaliation, including intimidation, threats, or coercion, because an employee or applicant has objected to discrimination, engaged or may engage in filing a complaint, assisted in a review, investigation, or hearing or has otherwise sought to obtain his/her legal rights under any Federal, State, or local EEO law regarding individuals with disabilities or protected veterans is prohibited.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, positive, continuing affirmative action programs have been established in the Company's policies and practices to assess that equal opportunity is being afforded to qualified women, minorities, individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.  The Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO”) is committed to the principles of affirmative action and equal opportunity employment.  The CEO has designated the Director of Legal to be the official at the Company responsible for implementation of affirmative action programs to ensure their continued effectiveness (the “EEO Administrator”).  One of the duties of the EEO Administrator will be to establish and maintain an internal audit and reporting system to allow for effective measurement of the Company's programs.</p>

      <p>In furtherance of the Company's policy regarding affirmative action and equal employment opportunity, the Company has developed a written affirmative action program, which sets forth the policies, practices and procedures that the Company is committed to for affirmative action for qualified females, minorities, individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.  The narrative portions of the Company's affirmative action plans for individuals with disabilities and protected veterans are available at the Company's offices for inspection during normal business hours.  Employees and applicants interested in inspecting these plans should contact the EEO Administrator for assistance.</p>

      <p>If you have any questions regarding our equal employment opportunity, harassment policies or the complaint procedure, you may contact the EEO Administrator.</p>
