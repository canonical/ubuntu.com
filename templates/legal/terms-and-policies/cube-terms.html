            <p>
                CUBE is a certification program that grants the user the opportunity to earn professional credentials in various Ubuntu subject areas. To this end, CUBE provides the following services:
            </p>
            <ul>

            </ul>
            <h2>2. Account</h2>
            <p>
                You will need an account to access and use the Service. We reserve the right to reject your request for an account or to immediately cancel or suspend your account and your use of the Service at any time if you do not comply with the following requirements. You must not attempt to create an account or use the Service if doing so would violate these Terms of Service. You must:

            </ul>
            <p>
                If you do not have an account you will need to create one. You are responsible for choosing an appropriate password for your accounts and for keeping such password secure. Canonical will not ask you for your password and you should not reveal it to anyone. You are responsible for keeping your account details up to date.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that by creating a Service account with us you will automatically create an account on the edX platform provided by City Network, which is required to administer the CUBE exam materials. The edX privacy policy can be found here: <a href="https://www.edx.org/edx-privacy-policy">https://www.edx.org/edx-privacy-policy</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The creation of an edX account will be subject to the edX Terms of Service which can be found here: <a href="https://www.edx.org/edx-terms-service">https://www.edx.org/edx-terms-service</a>. Administration (including deletion) of the edX account will be carried out through your edX account directly.

            <h2>3. Termination</h2>
            <p>
                We may cease to offer the services for any reason, in which case we will provide you with notice via the email associated with your account.
            </p>
            <h2>4. Changes</h2>
            <p>
                We continually aim to improve the delivery and content of the Service and accordingly may make changes to the Service from time to time.
            </p>
            <p>
                New features may be added, but we may also modify or discontinue (temporarily or permanently) part of the Service, in part or in whole. We may also offer Services on a trial/beta basis, in which case your use of those Services will be limited to the period of your trial/beta and subject to the terms of the trial/beta.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the event of a material change to the Service, we will notify you via the email associated with your account. What constitutes a material change in this circumstance will be determined by Canonical, in good faith and using common sense and reasonable judgment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, we may occasionally make changes to these Terms of Service and will notify you of material changes via the email associated with your account. If Canonical does make changes to these Terms of Service, all changes will go into effect at the time we post the updated Terms of Service or as otherwise notified at that time.
            </p>
            <h2>5. Intellectual property and content</h2>

            </p>
            <h3>Content</h3>
            <p>

            <p>
                Canonical is not responsible for any content  provided by any third party.

            <p>

            <h2>6. Fees</h2>

            </p>
            <p>
