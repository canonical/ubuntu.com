# Snap Store Terms of Service

These Terms of Service cover your use of the Snap Store as provided by Canonical Group Limited registered in England, company number 110334C ("**Canonical**", "**us**", "**we**" or "**our**").

Please read these terms carefully before you use the Snap Store or create a Snap Store account. By using the Snap Store or registering for an account, you agree to be bound by these terms.

If you register for a Snap Store account on behalf of an entity, you represent that you have authority to bind such entity to these terms.

You must be at least 13 years old to use the Snap Store. If you are aged between 13 and 18, we require your parent's or legal guardian's consent to create a Snap Store account or use the Snap Store. Please contact us at [legal@canonical.com](mailto:legal@canonical.com).

## 1\. Definitions

**Snap**: a single file to transport a software payload, which may include binary code, data, configuration, policies, metadata and other content. Snaps may be used to distribute an application, kernel, or other software.

**Snap Store**: the Canonical-hosted infrastructure for publishing and distributing Snaps.

## 2\. Use of the Snap Store

You may use the Snap Store to browse, locate, or download Snaps. Snaps may be published by Canonical or by third parties. Snaps may be updated from time to time; you agree to receive such updates for Snaps that you have downloaded. You may also create a Snap Store account, as described below, to publish your own Snaps.

## 3\. Account

A Snap Store account is accessed through an Ubuntu single sign-on account or other specified account mechanism. If you don't already have an Ubuntu single sign-on account, you will be prompted to create one. You are responsible for the security and confidentiality of your account and for keeping your account details up to date.

You will notify us immediately if your account information is lost, stolen, or otherwise compromised. Any activity completed through your account will be deemed to have been completed by you.

## 4\. Your Snaps

- 4.1 Once you have accepted these terms and created an account, you may publish Snaps to the Snap Store.
- 4.2 You represent that the Snaps you publish to the Snap Store do not infringe any intellectual property right of any third party or any applicable law or regulation.
- 4.3 Canonical may remove your Snap from the Snap Store at any time in its sole discretion.
- 4.4 You may remove your Snap from the Snap Store at any time. Removing a Snap from will prevent new discovery and installation, but will not remove the Snap from those users who have previously installed it.

## 5\. Prohibited use of Snap Store

You agree to use the Snap Store only for purposes that are legal and in accordance with these terms and any applicable policies or guidelines. By way of example, and not as a limitation, you will not provide any content or use the Snap Store in a way that:

- 5.2 is defamatory, harmful to minors, or pornographic;
- 5.3 contains hate-related or violent content;
- 5.4 might be libellous or defamatory;
- 5.5 contains threats or incites violence towards individuals or entities;
- 5.6 violates the privacy or publicity rights of any third party;
- 5.7 contains or distributes any viruses or programming routines intended to damage, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or information or otherwise affect the ability of Canonical to provide the Snap Store;
- 5.8 attempts to reverse engineer or otherwise access the Snap Store infrastructure;

or

- 5.9 violates or encourages conduct that would violate any criminal laws, any other applicable laws, or any third-party rights.

- 6.2 You will include the applicable licence for your Snap to end users of your Snap and identify the licence in the Snap information. If you require an agreement to be displayed to the end user, you will configure your Snap to display it upon the user's first run of the Snap.
