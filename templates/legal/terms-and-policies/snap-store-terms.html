   <p class="p-heading--3">
     Valid since October 2020
   </p>
   <p>

   </p>
   <p>
     Please read these terms carefully before you use the Snap Store or create a Snap Store account. By using the Snap Store or registering for an account, you agree to be bound by these terms. 
   </p>
   <p>
     If you register for a Snap Store account on behalf of an entity, you represent that you have authority to bind such entity to these terms. 
   </p>
   <p>
     You must be at least 13 years old to use the Snap Store. If you are aged between 13 and 18, we require your parent's or legal guardian's consent to create a Snap Store account or use the Snap Store. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@canonical.com">legal@canonical.com</a>. 
   </p>
   <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
   <p>
     <b>Snap</b>: a single file to transport a software payload, which may include binary code, data, configuration, policies, metadata and other content. Snaps may be used to distribute an application, kernel, or other software.
   </p>
   <p>
     <b>Snap Store</b>: the Canonical-hosted infrastructure for publishing and distributing Snaps. 
   </p>
   <h2>2. Use of the Snap Store</h2>
   <p>
     You may use the Snap Store to browse, locate, or download Snaps. Snaps may be published by Canonical or by third parties. Snaps may be updated from time to time; you agree to receive such updates for Snaps that you have downloaded. You may also create a Snap Store account, as described below, to publish your own Snaps.
   </p>
   <h2>3. Account</h2>
   <p>
     A Snap Store account is accessed through an Ubuntu single sign-on account or other specified account mechanism. If you don't already have an Ubuntu single sign-on account, you will be prompted to create one. You are responsible for the security and confidentiality of your account and for keeping your account details up to date. 
   </p>
   <p>
    You will notify us immediately if your account information is lost, stolen, or otherwise compromised. Any activity completed through your account will be deemed to have been completed by you.
   </p>
