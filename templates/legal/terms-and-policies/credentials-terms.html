            <p>
                The Canonical Credentials service is a certification program that grants you the opportunity to earn professional credentials in various Ubuntu subject areas. To this end, Canonical provides the following services:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A platform for recording certification progress, purchasing access to the Canonical Credentials service materials, and sharing earned credentials online.</li>

                <li>Access to Paid Content through the platform, if applicable.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>2. Account</h2>
            <p>
                You will need to register for a Single Sign On (SSO) account and Ubuntu One account to access and use the Service. SSO is an identity provider service that creates, maintains and manages user identity information, providing authentication services for Canonical and other third party applications. Ubuntu One the single account you use to log in to all services and sites related to www.ubuntu.com. We reserve the right to reject your request for an SSO and/or Ubuntu One account or to immediately cancel or suspend your SSO and/or Ubuntu One account and your use of the Service at any time if you do not comply with the following requirements. You must not attempt to create an SSO and/or Ubuntu One account or use the Service if doing so would violate these Terms of Service. You must:
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li>not use the Service for illegal or unauthorised purposes (or which encourage or permit illegal or authorised purposes), in infringement of a third party's’ rights or otherwise in accordance with these Terms of Service;</li>
                <li>not use take any action or use the Service in any way that might bring Canonical into disrepute or affect the ability of Canonical to provide the Service; </li>
                <li>not use the Service in any manner that might be libellous or defamatory, that contains threats or incites violence towards individuals or entities, or that violates the privacy rights of any third party.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you do not have both an SSO account and Ubuntu One account you will need to create these. You are responsible for choosing an appropriate password for your accounts and for keeping such password secure. Canonical will not ask you for your password and you should not reveal it to anyone.
