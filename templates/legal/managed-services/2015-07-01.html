                  <li class="p-list__item">Provide Canonical with the starting information required for Canonical to provide the Cloud</li>

                  <li class="p-list__item">Ensure there is an available remote access for Canonical support personnel to the Cloud</li>

In such case, subject to agreement of appropriate licence terms, Canonical will hand over the administrative control of Landscape and the Nagios monitoring tool to customer and customer can continue to monitor it.</p>
            <p>Should customer choose to discontinue the Services, customer will choose one of the following options:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="p-list__item">Canonical will transfer the ownership of the hosts to customer.
