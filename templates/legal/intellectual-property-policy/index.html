      <h1>Intellectual property rights&nbsp;policy</h1>
      <p>Latest update: We updated this policy on 15 July 2015.</p>
      <p>Welcome to Canonical's IPRights Policy. This policy is published by Canonical Limited (Canonical, we, us and our) under the Creative Commons CC-BY-SA version 3.0 UK licence.</p>
      <p>Canonical owns and manages certain intellectual property rights in Ubuntu and other associated intellectual property (Canonical IP) and licences the use of these rights to enterprises, individuals and members of the Ubuntu community in accordance with this IPRights Policy.</p>
      <p>Your use of Canonical IP is subject to:</p>
      <ul class="p-list p-list--divided">
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Your acceptance of this IPRights Policy;</li>
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Your acknowledgement that Canonical IP is the exclusive property of Canonical and can only be used with Canonical's permission (which can be revoked at any time); and</li>
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">You taking all reasonable steps to ensure that Canonical IP is used in a manner that does not affect either the validity of such Canonical IP or Canonical's ownership of Canonical IP in any way; and that you will transfer any goodwill you
          derive from them to Canonical, if requested.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ubuntu is a trusted open source platform. To maintain that trust we need to manage the use of Ubuntu and the components within it very carefully. This way, when people use Ubuntu, or anything bearing the Ubuntu brand, they can be assured that it will meet the standards they expect. Your continued use of Canonical IP implies your acceptance and acknowledgement of this IPRights Policy.</p>

      <p>Ubuntu is an aggregate work of many works, each covered by their own licence(s).

For further information, please contact us (as set out below).</li>
