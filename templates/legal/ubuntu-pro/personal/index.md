# Ubuntu Pro - personal, Terms of Service

## 1. Introduction

These Terms of Service cover the provision of Canonical's **Ubuntu Pro - personal (no support)** Service (the "<dfn>Service</dfn>") by Canonical Group Limited ("<dfn>Canonical</dfn>", "<dfn>us</dfn>", "<dfn>our</dfn>" or "<dfn>we</dfn>") to you ("<dfn>you</dfn>" or "<dfn>your</dfn>") subject to and in accordance with these Terms of Service. Please read these Terms of Service carefully before you use the Service. By using the Service, you agree to become bound by these Terms of Service.

If you have an executed agreement with a Canonical group company which includes a licence to the software your use of the software may be governed by that agreement. Otherwise, these Terms of Service will apply.

If you are entering into these Terms of Service on behalf of a company or legal entity, you must identify the company or legal entity when registering for the Service and use your company or legal entity contact information in order to register. You represent that you have authority to bind such company or legal entity, its officers, employees and agents and all users who access the Service through the account, to these Terms of Service. "You" and "your" shall refer to the company or legal entity and such users. If you do not have such authority do not accept these Terms of Service. The Service offering is limited to one account per company or legal entity.    

You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. If you are between age 13 and 18, you confirm that you have your parent's or legal guardian's consent to use the Services and that they have read and agreed to these Terms of Service.

Canonical may update these Terms of Service from time to time in its discretion.

## 2. Service

The Service provides users of Ubuntu with a free subscription to use the Service on up to five physical or virtual Ubuntu systems for the eligible Ubuntu LTS versions as designated by Canonical.

Details about the Service can be found here:  https://ubuntu.com/legal/ubuntu-pro-description

For recognised Ubuntu Community Members (as designated by Canonical) the Services can be used on up to fifty physical or virtual Ubuntu systems for the eligible Ubuntu LTS versions as designated by Canonical. 

## 3. Account

You will need a Single Sign On Ubuntu One account to access and use the Service. If you do not have an account you will need to create one. You are responsible for choosing an appropriate password for your accounts and for keeping such password secure. Canonical will not ask you for your password and you should not reveal it to anyone. You are responsible for keeping your account details up to date.

We reserve the right to reject your request for an account or to immediately cancel or suspend your account and your use of the Services at any time if you do not comply with the following requirements. You must not attempt to create an account or use the Service if doing so would violate these Terms of Service. You must not:            

- use the software made available through the Service for more than the entitled number of physical or virtual Ubuntu systems except as otherwise agreed, nor resell or attempt to resell the Services.

- use the Service for a company or legal entity without identifying the company or legal entity when registering for the Service and using your company or legal entity contact information in order to register.

- use the Services for more than five physical or virtual Ubuntu systems for the eligible Ubuntu LTS versions as designated by Canonical per company or legal entity.

- use the Service for illegal or unauthorised purposes (or encourage or permit illegal or unauthorised purposes), in infringement of a third party's rights or otherwise cause an adverse impact to the Services.

- be located in or use the Services in an OFAC/EAR embargoed or sanctioned country or be on the U.S. Commerce Department's Denied Persons List, Entity List, or Unverified List.

## 4. End of Service

We look forward to providing you with the Service for so long as you wish to receive it. However, there are some circumstances under which the Service may be suspended or terminated:

- we cease to make the Service (or any part thereof) available.    

- by us at any time as described in Section 3 above.          

We may also cease to offer the services for any other reason, in which case we will provide you with notice on your account page.    

## 5. Intellectual property

You have a non-exclusive, non-transferable (to the extent permitted by law) right to view, access and use the Services for such time as it is made available by us strictly in accordance with these Terms of Service.

You will not acquire any rights to the Service (or the intellectual property rights contained therein) from your use of the Service, other than as set out in these Terms of Service.

## 6. Personal data

No party will have the authority to bind the other party or to contract in the name of or create a liability against the other party. Failure by Canonical to enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

The terms of these Terms of Service do not affect your statutory rights.
