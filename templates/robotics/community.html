        How to join the ROS and Ubuntu community
      </h1>
      <p>
        ROS exists because of contributions from tens of thousands of developers. It started in Stanford, went on to be used in Universities around the world and is now a global community of roboticists who talk, code and meet-up every year.

        Every week the Ubuntu robotics team contributes to the future of security in robotics. And every week there are countless new projects started and improved by the community that go under the radar. The State of Robotics is a monthly blog series produced by the Canonical team to highlight the work and advancements happening in the robotics ecosystem. Why not have a read or get in touch to talk about your project?

      <p>
        The best place to start is in the <a href="https://discourse.ros.org/">ROS Discourse</a> where thousands of roboticists go to talk. If you have specific questions there's the <a href="https://answers.ros.org/questions/">ROS Answers</a> forum with over 13,000 questions to date. And for more context, you can read the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/">ROS Wiki</a> or the ROS 2 docs that have been worked on by almost 3,500 people.

        The ROS 2 technical steering committee

        Ubuntu is playing a significant role in the future of ROS. Canonical sits on the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) for ROS 2, to guide the future of robotics towards staying on the collaborative, accessible path it is on today. To aid in this, Canonical is also the Chair of the ROS 2 Security working group. Just as we ensure Ubuntu's security and reliability for users, we are instilling the same ideals into ROS&nbsp;2.
