		<p>Fonts have become one of the most essential communication tools today.</p><p>They allow us to convey our thoughts to one another, be that by letter or text message, with clarity and purpose.</p><p>Dalton Maag, a London-based studio, has laid the foundations for the Ubuntu font project with a beautiful design that aims to produce every character to support every language and interest in the world.</p><p>This is the most ambitious font project ever undertaken. Its success depends on the willingness of designers around the world to participate and work with the teams at Dalton Maag and Canonical to deliver the most comprehensive font suite ever. It&rsquo;s a true testament to the power of collaborative working in technology and design.</p>

		<p>The leader of the Ubuntu Project, Canonical, believes that everyone has the right to a fast, safe and free computing experience. That&rsquo;s where the Ubuntu operating system comes in &mdash; created by a global community of open-source experts, it reflects the meaning of the word Ubuntu: &lsquo;I am what I am because of who we all are&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Driven by Dalton Maag and Canonical, the Ubuntu font project showcases many of the values of Ubuntu itself &mdash; it&rsquo;s stylish, precise, accessible and, perhaps most importantly, developed in the spirit of collaboration.</p>

		<p>This bold and ambitious project will see Ubuntu reach new audiences with a beautiful, distinctive font that has raised the bar for open font creation.</p>
