      <h2>Long term support and interim releases</h2>

      <h3>Version numbers are YY.MM</h3>

      <p>Releases of Ubuntu get a development codename ('{{ releases.latest.name }}') and are versioned by the year and month of delivery - for example, Ubuntu {{ releases.latest.short_version }} was released in {{ releases.latest.release_date }}.</p>

      <p>LTS or 'Long Term Support' releases are published every two years in April. LTS releases are the 'enterprise grade' releases of Ubuntu and are used the most. An estimated 95% of all Ubuntu installations are LTS releases.</p>

      <p>Ubuntu LTS releases receive 5 years of standard security maintenance for all packages in the ‘Main’ repository. With an Ubuntu Pro subscription, you get access to Expanded Security Maintenance (ESM) covering security fixes for packages in both the ‘Main’ and ‘Universe’ repositories for 10 years.
         <a href="/support">Phone and ticket support</a> is also available and can be optionally added on top of an Ubuntu Pro subscription, covering the same packages covered by ESM, for the same time frame.
      </p>

      <p>Optional Legacy support add-on on top of Ubuntu Pro extends the security maintenance and support for an additional 2 years, resulting in 12 years coverage overall.</p>
      
      <p>Every six months between LTS versions, Canonical publishes an interim release of Ubuntu, with {{ releases.latest.short_version }} being the latest example. These are production-quality releases and are supported for 9 months, with sufficient time provided for users to update, but these releases do not receive the long-term commitment of LTS releases.</p>
    </div>

    {% include "/about/release_cycles/ubuntu-eol.html" %}

    <div class="u-fixed-width">
      <p>ESM and phone and ticket support require Ubuntu Pro subscription.</p>
      <p>Interim releases will introduce new capabilities from Canonical and upstream open source projects, they serve as a proving ground for these new capabilities. Many developers run interim releases because they provide newer compilers or access to newer kernels and newer libraries, and they are often used inside rapid devops processes like CI/CD pipelines where the lifespan of an artefact is likely to be less than the support period of the interim release. Interim releases receive full security maintenance for 'main' during their lifespan.</p>

      <h2>Maintenance and security updates</h2>

      <p>The debs in Ubuntu are categorised by whether they are considered part of the base system ('main' and 'restricted' are in the base and 'universe' and 'multiverse' are not) and whether they are open source ('main' and 'universe' are, 'restricted' and 'multiverse' are not).</p>

      <table style="margin-top: 1rem;">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>&nbsp;</th>
            <th scope="col">Ubuntu Base Packages</th>
            <th scope="col">Community Packages</th>

          </tr>
          <tr>

      </table>

      <p>For each Ubuntu LTS release, Canonical maintains the Base Packages and provides security updates, including kernel
        livepatching, and optional phone and ticket support, for a period of ten years. The lifecycle consists of an initial
        five-year standard security maintenance period, during which maintenance updates are publicly available without a
        subscription, and five years of <a href="/security/esm">Expanded Security Maintenance (ESM)</a>. Furthermore ESM also
        covers 10 years of security maintenance for the Universe repository, which is not provided outside of Ubuntu Pro
        subscription. The full 10 year Ubuntu LTS lifecycle is available with an <a href="/pro">Ubuntu Pro subscription</a>
        (free for personal use on up to 5 machines). Technical phone and ticket support is only available as an add-on to an
        Ubuntu Pro subscription.

      <h2>Release components - debs, snaps, images, containers</h2>

      <p>A release of Ubuntu is made through several different channels. What you consume will depend on where you are and what your interests happen to be.</p>

      <p>The heart of Ubuntu is a collection of 'deb' packages which are tested and integrated so that they work well as a set. Debs are optimised for highly structured dependency management, enabling you to combine debs very richly while ensuring that the necessary software dependencies for each deb (themselves delivered as debs) are installed on your machine.</p>

      <p>Ubuntu also supports 'snap' packages which are more suited for third-party applications and tools which evolve at their own speed, independently of Ubuntu. If you want to install a high-profile app like Skype or a toolchain like the latest version of Golang, you probably want the snap because it will give you fresher versions and more control of the specific major versions you want to track.</p>

      <p>Snaps each pick a 'base', for example, Ubuntu18 (corresponding to the set of minimal debs in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS). Nevertheless, the choice of base does not impact on your ability to use a snap on any of the supported Linux distributions or versions &mdash; it's a choice of the publisher and should be invisible to you as a user or developer.</p>

      <p>A snap can be strictly confined, which means that it operates in a secure box with only predefined points of access to the rest of the system. For third-party applications, this means that you will have a very high level of confidence that the app can only see appropriate data that you have provided to it. Snaps can also be 'classic' which means that they behave more like debs, and can see everything on your system. You should make sure you have a high level of confidence in the publisher of any classic snap you install since a compromise or bad faith behaviour in that code is not confined to the app itself.</p>

      <p>It is also common to consume Ubuntu as an image on a public cloud, or as a container. Ubuntu is published by Canonical on all major public clouds, and the latest image for each LTS version will always include security updates rolled up to at most two weeks ago. You may benefit from installing newer updates than that, but the base image you boot on the cloud should always be the current one from Canonical to ensure that it is broadly up to date and the number of updates needed for full security is minimal.</p>

      <p>Canonical also publishes a set of images and containers that you can download for use with VMware or other local hypervisors and private cloud technologies. These include standard Ubuntu images on the Docker Hub and standard images for use with LXD and MAAS. These images are also kept up to date, with the publication of rolled up security updated images on a regular cadence, and you should automate your use of the latest images to ensure consistent security coverage for your users.</p>

      <h2>Editions, Classic and Core</h2>

      <p>Each release of Ubuntu is available in minimal configurations which have the fewest possible packages installed: available in the installer for Server, Desktop and as separate cloud images. There are also multiple flavours of desktop Ubuntu corresponding to a number of desktop GUI preferences. All of these images are considered 'Classic' Ubuntu because they use debs as their base and may add snaps for specific packages or applications.</p>

      <p>The Ubuntu Core image is an all-snap edition of Ubuntu. It is unusual in that the base operating system itself is delivered as a snap; that makes it suitable for embedded appliances where all the possible apps that might need to be installed are available as strictly confined snaps. Ubuntu Core is an appliance or embedded oriented edition of Ubuntu, not particularly comfortable for humans but highly reliable and secure for large-scale appliance deployments such as IoT and CPE in the telco world.</p>

      <h2>Ubuntu kernel release cycle</h2>

      <p>Canonical maintains multiple kernel packages for each LTS version of Ubuntu, which serve different purposes. Several of the kernel packages address the need for kernels with specific performance priorities, for example, the low-latency kernel package. Others are focused on optimisation for a particular hypervisor, for example, the kernel packages which are named after public clouds. You are recommended to use the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel">detailed Ubuntu kernel guide</a> to select the best Ubuntu kernel for your application.</p>

      <p>In general, all of the LTS kernel packages will use the same base version of the Linux kernel, for example, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS kernels typically used the 5.4 upstream Linux kernel as a base. Some cloud-specific kernels may use a newer version in order to benefit from improved mechanisms in performance or security that are material to that cloud. These kernels are all supported for the full life of their underlying LTS release.</p>

      <p>In addition, the kernel versions from the subsequent four releases are made available on the latest LTS release of Ubuntu. So Ubuntu 18.04 LTS received the kernels from Ubuntu 18.10, 19.04, 19.10 and 20.04 LTS. These kernels use newer upstream versions and as a result, offer an easy path to newer features and newer classes of hardware for many users of Ubuntu. Note however that these kernels 'roll' which means that they jump every six months until the next LTS. Large scale deployments that adopt the 'hardware enablement' or HWE kernels should manage those transitions explicitly. These newer HWE kernels are accompanied by a collection of userspace tools closely tied to the kernel and hardware, specifically X display enablement on newer graphics cards.</p>

      <h2>OpenStack release cycle</h2>

      <p>The <a href="/openstack">OpenStack</a> release cadence follows the Ubuntu release cadence. This means that new versions of OpenStack are released twice a year: in April and in October. Those are shipped with new versions of Ubuntu as packages in the <a href="https://packages.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Archive</a>.</p>

      <p>However, since Canonical recommends using only LTS versions of Ubuntu in production environments, this limits available OpenStack versions to one by default. Therefore, Canonical maintains an additional archive &ndash; <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OpenStack/CloudArchive">Ubuntu Cloud Archive</a> &ndash; to provide access to newer versions of OpenStack on Ubuntu LTS.</p>

      <p>As a result, OpenStack versions that are shipped on Ubuntu LTS by default (aka OpenStack LTS versions) benefit from Canonical's commitment around the Ubuntu Archive, including 5 years of standard security maintenance and <a href="/security/esm">Expanded Security Maintenance (ESM)</a> available to <a href="/pro">Ubuntu Pro and Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only) customers</a>. In turn, OpenStack versions which are shipped on Ubuntu LTS through the Ubuntu Cloud Archive are maintained by Canonical for 18 months only, except for some versions that are maintained for 36 months under Ubuntu Pro and Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only).</p>

Since MicroStack does not use OpenStack packages directly, but rather uses snaps and open container initiative (OCI) images, its support lifecycle is different from Charmed OpenStack.</p>
    
      <p>The first supported version of OpenStack in MicroStack is Antelope. It will be supported until April 2026. Every LTS version of OpenStack will benefit from 10 years of support moving forward. Every second, non LTS version of OpenStack will benefit from 3 years of support moving forward. Only every second version of OpenStack will be supported moving forward. Users will be able to securely upgrade between supported versions of OpenStack using the Skip Level Upgrade Release Process (SLURP) mechanism for 2 years after the next LTS version release.</p>
