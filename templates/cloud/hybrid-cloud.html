          How does a hybrid

          Since the hybrid cloud is a cloud computing architecture that uses existing public and private cloud infrastructure, the way it works is not significantly different from how public and private clouds work on their own.
        </h3>
        <p>
          The hybrid cloud leverages virtualisation, containerisation, software-defined networking (SDN) and software-defined storage (SDS) technologies to divide physical resources, aggregated into pools, and allocate them to virtual machines (VMs) or containers. Dedicated <a href="/openstack/what-is-openstack">management software</a> is used to aggregate compute, network and storage resources, distributed across the data centre, and enable on-demand provisioning of virtualised resources through a self-service portal.
        </p>
        <p>
          What differentiates hybrid cloud from other cloud architectures is  the additional layer of software, running on top of existing clouds. Known as the HCM, this software enables <a href="https://juju.is">deploying, integrating and migrating workloads between private and public clouds</a> depending on capacity and cost conditions. Since <a href="/engage/cloud-pricing-report-2021">private clouds prove to be more cost-effective than public clouds</a> when running workloads in the long term and at scale, the majority of the workloads should always be run in the private cloud. However, organisations can move their workloads to the public cloud during heavy load periods. HCM enables this migration across various cloud providers, ensuring maximum CAPEX and OPEX efficiency.

            Hybrid cloud and <a href="/cloud/multi-cloud">multi-cloud</a> are two mutually exclusive terms that are often confused.

          <p>
            The hybrid cloud is a cloud computing architecture that consists of at least one public cloud, at least one private cloud and the HCM. There are no assumptions in this definition about the service provider behind public and private cloud infrastructure. In turn, multi-cloud simply refers to using multiple clouds from more than one cloud service provider at the same time.

              No, it is not. Multi-cloud also refers to using multiple public clouds (e.g. <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-gb/marketplace/apps/canonical.0001-com-ubuntu-pro-bionic">Azure</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/ubuntu-pro-available-on-google-cloud">GCP</a>) or multiple private clouds (e.g. <a href="https://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a> and <a href="/openstack">OpenStack</a>) at the same time and this is not a hybrid cloud architecture.

            The main benefit of the hybrid cloud architecture is <a href="/engage/hybrid-cloud-business-guide">better economics</a> compared to using only public or private clouds. Hybrid cloud effectively combines advantages of both, resulting in a number of benefits. Those include:

            <p>
              In the hybrid cloud workloads always run where it makes the most sense from the economical standpoint. This means organisations always pay as little as possible for the same amount of resources which results in long-term cost savings.

            <p>
              Since various public and private clouds may use different application programming interfaces (APIs) and cloud architectures, managing workloads in the hybrid model is challenging. Using <a href="https://juju.is">workload management software that is substrate-agnostic</a> helps to bypass those challenges, ensuring compatibility across various cloud providers.

            <p>
              With the hybrid cloud architecture there is no longer a single cloud environment. There are at least two.

One way to deal with that is to leverage <a href="/openstack/managed">managed cloud services</a>.

        <p>
          Using this architecture proves to be the best way to achieve infrastructure cost optimisation, however, implementing the hybrid cloud requires building a private cloud which may not be an option due to the significant upfront costs of  building a private cloud. Organisations should always carefully analyse their requirements and choose a cloud architecture that provides the best economics. Using private cloud cost calculators can help make the right decision.

            These are just a few examples of questions organisations have to ask themselves at the beginning of their hybrid cloud journey. Fortunately, there are <a href="https://microstack.run">tools that enable single-node private cloud installation</a> for testing purposes or, in the case of more complex environments, platform integrators like Canonical offer <a href="/openstack/consulting">consulting services for private cloud implementation</a>. Those usually include existing workloads assessment, architecture guidance, TCO prediction, private cloud deployment, workloads migration and hybrid cloud integration.
