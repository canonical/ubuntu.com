      <h1>What is hybrid cloud?</h1>
      <p>Hybrid cloud is a <a href="/cloud/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a> architecture that consists of at least one public cloud, at least one private cloud and a hybrid cloud manager (HCM). It is one of the most popular trends in the IT industry, used by 82% of enterprises according to the <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/hybrid-cloud/2022-trends.html">Cisco 2022 Global Hybrid Cloud Trends Report</a>.</p>
      <p>Hybrid clouds enable organisations to optimise their infrastructure costs by always running their workloads where it makes more sense from an economical standpoint.</p>

      <h2>How does a hybrid<br/> cloud work?</h2>
      <h4>Since the hybrid cloud is a cloud computing architecture that uses existing public and private cloud infrastructure, the way it works is not significantly different from how public and private clouds work on their own.</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="col-7">
      <p>The hybrid cloud leverages virtualisation, containerisation, software-defined networking (SDN) and software-defined storage (SDS) technologies to divide physical resources, aggregated into pools, and allocate them to virtual machines (VMs) or containers. Dedicated <a href="/openstack/what-is-openstack">management software</a> is used to aggregate compute, network and storage resources, distributed across the data centre, and enable on-demand provisioning of virtualised resources through a self-service portal.</p>
      <p>What differentiates hybrid cloud from other cloud architectures is  the additional layer of software, running on top of existing clouds. Known as the HCM, this software enables <a href="https://juju.is">deploying, integrating and migrating workloads between private and public clouds</a> depending on capacity and cost conditions. Since <a href="/engage/cloud-pricing-report-2021">private clouds prove to be more cost-effective than public clouds</a> when running workloads in the long term and at scale, the majority of the workloads should always be run in the private cloud. However, organisations can move their workloads to the public cloud during heavy load periods. HCM enables this migration across various cloud providers, ensuring maximum CAPEX and OPEX efficiency.</p>

      <h2>Hybrid cloud vs<br/> multi-cloud</h2>
      <h4>Hybrid cloud and <a href="/cloud/multi-cloud">multi-cloud</a> are two mutually exclusive terms that are often confused.</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="col-7">
      <p>The hybrid cloud is a cloud computing architecture that consists of at least one public cloud, at least one private cloud and the HCM. There are no assumptions in this definition about the service provider behind public and private cloud infrastructure. In turn, multi-cloud simply refers to using multiple clouds from more than one cloud service provider at the same time.</p>
      <h5 class="u-no-margin--bottom u-no-padding--top">Is every hybrid cloud a multi-cloud?</h5>
      <p>No, imagine a <a href="/cloud">cloud architecture</a> that consists of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-rhaqbfd6lepbw">AWS</a> and <a href="/aws/outposts">AWS Outposts</a> at the same time. It uses a public cloud and a private cloud infrastructure, but both are delivered by a single cloud provider.</p>
      <h5 class="u-no-margin--bottom u-no-padding--top">Is every multi-cloud a hybrid cloud?</h5>
      <p>No, it is not. Multi-cloud also refers to using multiple public clouds (e.g. <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-gb/marketplace/apps/canonical.0001-com-ubuntu-pro-bionic">Azure</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/ubuntu-pro-available-on-google-cloud">GCP</a>) or multiple private clouds (e.g. <a href="https://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a> and <a href="/openstack">OpenStack</a>) at the same time and this is not a hybrid cloud architecture.</p>

      <h2>Hybrid cloud benefits</h2>
      <p class="u-sv3">The main benefit of the hybrid cloud architecture is <a href="/engage/hybrid-cloud-business-guide">better economics</a> compared to using only public or private clouds. Hybrid cloud effectively combines advantages of both, resulting in a number of benefits. Those include:</p>

      <h4>Maximum infrastructure costs optimisation</h4>
      <p class="u-sv3">In the hybrid cloud workloads always run where it makes the most sense from the economical standpoint. This means organisations always pay as little as possible for the same amount of resources which results in long-term cost savings.</p>

      <h4>Optimal resource utilisation</h4>
      <p class="u-sv3">Every underutilised resource in the data centre is a waste of money for the business. In the hybrid cloud architecture, the private cloud always runs at its maximum capacity, while workloads are moved to the public cloud during heavy load periods.</p>

      </div>
      <h4>Compatibility</h4>
      <p>Since various public and private clouds may use different application programming interfaces (APIs) and cloud architectures, managing workloads in the hybrid model is challenging. Using <a href="https://juju.is">workload management software that is substrate-agnostic</a> helps to bypass those challenges, ensuring compatibility across various cloud providers.</p>

      <h4>Increased complexity</h4>
      <p>With the hybrid cloud architecture there is no longer a single cloud environment. There are at least two. This increases the complexity of the infrastructure and creates additional overhead for the cloud operations team. One way to deal with that is to leverage <a href="/openstack/managed">managed cloud services</a>.</p>

      <p>Using this architecture proves to be the best way to achieve infrastructure cost optimisation, however, implementing the hybrid cloud requires building a private cloud which may not be an option due to the significant upfront costs of  building a private cloud.
