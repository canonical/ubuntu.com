      <h1>What is multi-cloud?</h1>
      <p>Multi-cloud (also referred to as multi cloud or multi-cloud) is a concept that refers to <a href="/engage/multi-cloud-business-guide"></a>using multiple clouds</a> from more than one cloud service provider at the same time. The term is also used to refer to the simultaneous running of bare metal, virtualised and containerised workloads.</p>
      <p>In conjunction with a hybrid cloud architecture, the multi-cloud approach enables organisations to optimise their infrastructure costs. Multi-cloud reflects the reality of most organisations today and is expected to become the standard for cloud infrastructure in the coming years.</p>

      <h2>How does a multi-<br/> cloud work?</h2>
      <h4>Since multi-cloud is just a concept that refers to using multiple cloud platforms from more than one cloud service provider at the same time, the way it works is not significantly different from how public and private clouds work on their own.</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="col-7">
      <p>Multi-cloud leverages virtualisation, containerisation, software-defined networking (SDN) and software-defined storage (SDS) technologies to divide physical resources, aggregated into pools, and allocate them to virtual machines (VMs) or containers. Dedicated <a href="/openstack/what-is-openstack">management software</a> is used to aggregate compute, network and storage resources, distributed across the data centre, and enable on-demand provisioning of virtualised resources through a self-service portal.</p>
      <p>What differentiates multi-cloud from a single vendor model is an additional layer of abstraction provided by the <a href="https://juju.is">application management software</a> that runs on top of the existing clouds. This software treats each individual cloud platform as a resource provider and allows for deploying, integrating and managing Kubernetes, container and VM-native applications seamlessly across various clouds. This enables a substrate-agnostic approach to applications orchestration and results in time and cost savings usually spent on integration efforts.</p>

      <h2>Multi-cloud vs<br/>Hybrid cloud</h2>
      <h4>Multi-cloud and <a href="/cloud/hybrid-cloud">hybrid cloud</a> are two mutually exclusive terms that are often confused.</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="col-7">
      <p>Multi-cloud simply refers to using multiple clouds from more than one cloud service provider at the same time. In this definition there are no assumptions  about the cloud types being used. In turn, hybrid cloud is a cloud architecture that consists of at least one public cloud, at least one private cloud and the hybrid cloud manager (HCM).</p>
      <h5 class="u-no-margin--bottom u-no-padding--top">Is every hybrid cloud a multi-cloud?</h5>
      <p>No, imagine a <a href="/cloud">cloud architecture</a> that consists of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-rhaqbfd6lepbw">AWS</a> and <a href="/aws/outposts">AWS Outposts</a> at the same time. It uses a public cloud and a private cloud infrastructure, but both are delivered by a single cloud provider.</p>
      <h5 class="u-no-margin--bottom u-no-padding--top">Is every multi-cloud a hybrid cloud?</h5>
      <p>No, it is not. Multi-cloud also refers to using multiple public clouds (e.g. <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-gb/marketplace/apps/canonical.0001-com-ubuntu-pro-bionic">Azure</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/ubuntu-pro-available-on-google-cloud">GCP</a>) or multiple private clouds (e.g. <a href="https://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a> and <a href="/openstack">OpenStack</a>) at the same time and this is not a hybrid cloud architecture.</p>

      <h2>Multi-cloud benefits</h2>
      <p class="u-sv3">The main benefit of the multi-cloud approach is <a href="/engage/multi-cloud-business-guide">better economics</a> compared to using only one cloud platform at a time. Multi-cloud effectively combines the advantages brought by different cloud service providers, resulting in a number of benefits. Those include:</p>

      <h4>Compatibility</h4>
      <p>Since various cloud platforms may use different application programming interfaces (APIs) and architectures, managing workloads in a multi-cloud model is challenging. Using <a href="https://juju.is">applications management software that is substrate-agnostic</a> helps to bypass those challenges, ensuring compatibility across various cloud providers.</p>

      </div>
      <h4>Increased complexity</h4>
      <p>With multi-cloud there is no longer a single cloud environment. There are at least two. This increases the complexity of the infrastructure and creates additional overhead for the cloud operations team. One way to deal with this is to leverage <a href="/openstack/managed">managed cloud services</a>.</p>

      <h4>Greater attack surface</h4>
      <p>When using multiple cloud platforms at the same time, organisations are much more exposed to potential network attacks and security breaches. Using an <a href="/security">operating system that provides the highest possible level of security</a> as a basis for applications implementation helps to mitigate this threat.</p>

      <h4>The main reason behind multi-cloud existence is better economics compared to a single vendor model.</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="col-7">
      <p>Consuming services from more than one service provider at the same time allows organisations to negotiate better prices and always place their workloads where it makes the most sense from an economical standpoint. In addition, integrating with hybrid cloud architecture enables them to host the majority of their workloads in a private cloud and only using highly-scalable public cloud resources during heavy load periods. Since <a href="/engage/cloud-pricing-report-2021">private clouds prove to be more cost-effective</a> when running workloads in the long term and at scale, this approach allows for maximum infrastructure cost optimisation and results in long-term cost savings.</p>
