            <h2>Elasticity built-in</h2>
            <p>Even for experts, installing and operating Kubernetes at scale is daunting. By using Ubuntu and Juju, Canonical&rsquo;s Kubernetes is simple, naturally elastic and integrates with common operations dashboards. Charms deliver the latest stable Kubernetes and Juju makes it easy to manage and grow your cluster.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box six-col last-col equal-height--item">
            <h2>Your choice of infrastructure</h2>
            <p>The Canonical Distribution of Kubernetes is certified on most major public clouds and on-premise private infrastructure like VMware, OpenStack or bare-metal MAAS. The ability to move workloads is critical for organisations to remain competitive, foster innovation and avoid infrastructure lock-in.</p>

        <div class="box six-col equal-height--item">
            <h2>Analytics on tap</h2>
            <p>Canonical&rsquo;s Distribution of Kubernetes comes integrated with Prometheus for monitoring, Ceph for storage and a fully integrated Elastic Stack including Kibana for analysis and visualisations.</p>

        <div class="box six-col last-col equal-height--item">
            <h2>Cost-effective at scale</h2>
            <p>The major cost of Kubernetes is the  operations expertise needed to run at scale.  Canonical&rsquo;s Kubernetes bundle includes all operational scripting and tooling needed to manage a long-lived cluster, including upgrades and elastic scaling. With Juju you get all the industries best practices for Kubernetes ops for free.</p>
