      <p>Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over a network. In traditional data centres, compute and storage resources used to be allocated manually by a dedicated IT team. In the cloud, this process is fully automated, leading to increased agility and significant cost savings.</p>
      <p>Cloud computing is a <em>de facto</em> standard for modern data centre implementation and a foundation for <a href="/blog/what-is-cloud-native">cloud-native application</a> deployments. It is used by the majority of organisations worldwide. There is no reason why yours shouldn’t be next.</p>

      <h2>How does <br class="u-hide--small u-hide--medium" />cloud computing work?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-6">
      <h5>In essence, cloud computing is a modern way of delivering IT services for organisations and individuals. It hides the entire complexity of a data centre from an end user behind a self-service portal.</h5>
      <p>The name "cloud computing" comes from a common practice of representing complex IT systems on diagrams as a cloud. Modern data centres are complex. They consist of racks, power devices, network devices, servers, storage arrays, cables and many other components. The end user does not need to understand all these intricacies. All they need are resources that can be consumed quickly and on demand. Cloud computing abstracts all these complexities, turning the data centre into a resource rental store.</p>
      <p>Underneath, cloud computing uses numerous technologies, including <a href="/server/docs/virtualization-introduction">virtualisation</a>, <a href="/containers/what-are-containers">containerisation</a> and <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/IT-automation">automation</a>. At the heart of the cloud computing stack, there is <a href="/openstack/what-is-openstack">cloud management software</a>. This software manages compute, network and storage resources distributed across the entire data centre, aggregates them into pools and enables on-demand provisioning of resource chunks through a self-service portal. End users can request those resources to be provisioned in the form of virtual machines (VMs) or containers.</p>

      <h2>Cloud computing <br class="u-hide--small u-hide--medium" />vs virtualisation</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-6">
      <h5>Even though cloud computing uses virtualisation underneath, it is much more than that. While virtualisation is more like an engine, cloud computing is more like a car.</h5>
      <p>People who are new to cloud computing often get confused with the cloud computing vs virtualisation dilemma. Virtualisation is a technology that divides the physical resources of a server, such as the central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), storage and network, into chunks. Those can further be aggregated into VMs, consisting of virtual resources and allocated to end users. Hardware virtualisation, VM creation and termination is handled by a dedicated software, firmware or hardware component called a <a href="/blog/kvm-hyphervisor">hypervisor</a>.</p>
      <p>In turn, cloud computing expands the capabilities provided by the hypervisor. The cloud software manages all the hypervisors and automates the VM provisioning process. Whenever a cloud user requests a VM with specific parameters through the self-service portal, it tries to find the least utilised hypervisor (unless configured otherwise), schedules VM creation on this hypervisor and returns VM details back to the user. Likewise, it automates the creation of other types of virtual resources, such as block storage devices, virtual networks, and more.</p>

      <h2>Cloud computing benefits</h2>
      <p class="u-sv3">Compared to legacy IT infrastructure based on mainframes, blades and "pet” servers, cloud computing transforms data centres into resource pools, providing end users with immediate access to hardware: <a href="https://maas.io">physical</a> or <a href="/openstack/features">virtual</a>.

      <p>While there are many migration-as-a-service tools available on the market which facilitate <a href="/engage/cloud-migration-strategy-lift-and-shift-or-rebuild">lift and shift migration</a>, moving production workloads to the cloud might still be challenging.

      <h4>Redesigning workloads</h4>
      <p>Even though it is possible to just lift and shift legacy workloads to the cloud, organisations often have to re-design their workloads in the long term to benefit from all advantages of the cloud. Some take it as an opportunity to standardise on a <a href="/blog/what-is-cloud-native">cloud-native architecture</a> which leads to higher granularity, better scalability and increased resiliency.</p>

      <h4>Digital sovereignty</h4>

      <p>Cloud computing proves to be the most economical way to run modern business applications. Therefore, it has been adopted by the majority of organisations all over the world. However, achieving cost optimisation in cloud environments is a non-trivial task. It involves adopting cloud cost optimisation best practices, running a cost analysis and making data-driven decisions regarding the placement of workloads. Only when following those strict guidelines, can organisations achieve true total cost of ownership (TCO) reduction compared to legacy IT infrastructure.</p>

      <h4>IaaS</h4>
      <p>In the IaaS model, you provision resources. Those include the number of virtual CPUs (vCPUs), the amount of RAM, storage, etc. They come in the form of VMs or containers with a pre-installed operating system (OS). You manage everything up from there. IaaS is the most common cloud computing model as it allows for more freedom.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="p-card col-4">
      <h4>PaaS</h4>
      <p>In the PaaS model, you provision workloads. While you are still responsible for delivering application code and data management, the PaaS platform takes care of scheduling resources (usually containers) and manages them, including the OS, middleware and runtime. The PaaS model has never been widely adopted due to its overall complexity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="p-card col-4">
      <h4>SaaS</h4>
      <p>In the SaaS model, you provision applications. They are deployed from pre-defined templates and can be configured according to your needs. Everything is managed by the cloud provider. Interest in the SaaS model is constantly increasing as it allows for full automation from the ground up.</p>

      <h2>How to get started with cloud computing?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-6">
      <p>The easiest way to get started with cloud computing is in a public cloud. All leading public cloud providers, including <a href="/blog/aws-pricing">Amazon</a>, <a href="/blog/azure-pricing">Azure</a> and <a href="/blog/gcp-pricing">Google</a>, provide a free tier for newcomers, enabling them to use cloud resources up to a specific limit free of charge. Canonical partners with all of them, ensuring a frictionless experience when running Ubuntu workloads in public clouds. It also provides <a href="/pro">Ubuntu Pro</a> images with an extra security advantage for running production workloads on Ubuntu with confidence.</p>

      <p>However, public cloud costs tend to grow fast as the demand for workloads increases. As a result, organisations should consider adopting hybrid multi-cloud architecture when running cloud workloads in the long term and on a large scale. This involves building a <a href="/openstack">cost-effective private cloud platform</a> as an extension to hyperscaler infrastructure. Read <a href="/engage/cloud-pricing-report">Canonical's cloud pricing report</a> to learn more.</p>

      <p>When it comes to private cloud implementation, Canonical provides a number of solutions to build a cloud platform tailored to your needs. Refer to the official <a href="/openstack/install">installation instructions</a> to get a fully functional private cloud platform up and running in a few minutes. More demanding customers can also leverage Canonical's commercial services, including <a href="/openstack/consulting">private cloud design & delivery</a>, full <a href="/openstack/support">commercial support</a> and <a href="/openstack/managed">fully-managed services</a>.</p>
