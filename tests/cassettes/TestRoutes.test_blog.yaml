        June 29, 2021<\/strong> \u2013 Despite high adoption rates of cloud native
        technologies in recent years, enterprises have yet to cross the chasm to full
        adoption, but they\u2019re quickly moving in that direction, according to
        initial results of a first-of-its kind survey released today by Canonical,
        the publishers of<a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/\"> Ubuntu<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The<a
        href=\"https:\/\/juju.is\/cloud-native-kubernetes-usage-report-2021\"> Kubernetes
        and Cloud Native Operations Report<\/a>, which is still <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/kubernetes\/kubernetes-operations-survey\">open
        for participation<\/a>, has surveyed 1,200 global IT professionals so far
        on more than 40 topics about their usage of Kubernetes, bare metal, VMs, containers,
        and serverless applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report also includes insights
        from experts at Amazon, Google, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, WeaveWorks,
        Cloudbees, and HCL Technologies, whom Canonical brought together to assess
        the results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Showing the multi-dimensional nature of today\u2019s
        cloud native technology landscape, the survey found that while 45.6 percent
        of respondents report using Kubernetes in production, only 15.7 percent use
        Kubernetes exclusively.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly 30 percent run applications
        on a mix of bare metal, VMs and Kubernetes, 15.3 percent do so mostly on VMs
        with plans to fully migrate to Kubernetes, and 13.1 percent are on VMs and
        evaluating Kubernetes for deployment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI think this clearly
        shows we&#8217;ve got a long way to go before we&#8217;ve properly modernized
        the infrastructure,\u201d James Strachan, Distinguished Engineer at Cloudbees,
        said in the report.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly 78 percent of respondents reported
        at least one hybrid or multi-cloud use case in production in their organization.
        This number is likely higher than reported when teams consider SAAS or 3rd
        party managed services &#8212; those beyond what they directly manage themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As
        adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud continues to grow, new challenges are arising,
        particularly around managing the sprawl of diverse bare metal, VM, and Kubernetes
        technologies, the survey found.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Operations are said to
        be the next big challenge, with businesses looking at automation through application
        rather than configuration management. To that end nearly 30 percent say that
        trying out <a href=\"https:\/\/juju.is\">operators<\/a> is on their to-do
        list, with a further 17 percent already experimenting with them, and 14 percent
        using them in production.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> <a class=\"p-button--small
        p-button--positive\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a

        target=\"_blank\">Read full report<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other findings include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The top users of Kubernetes and cloud native technologies
        are SRE\/DevOps engineers, followed by infrastructure architects, back-end
        developers, and full-stack developers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The most important goals in using Kubernetes and cloud native technologies
        are improved maintenance, monitoring, and automation (cited by 64.6 percent
        of users), modernizing infrastructure (46.4 percent), and faster time to market
        (26.5 percent).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asked what
        they consider the most valuable qualities of these technologies, respondents
        cited cutting-edge capabilities, developer productivity, elasticity and agility,
        global reach, open source, portability, reduced OpEx and CapEx, resource optimization,
        and simpler operations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most
        common use cases for hybrid and multi-cloud are acceleration of development
        and increased automation (20.7 percent of respondents), expanding cloud backup
        options to cut costs (13.3 percent), disaster recovery (12.6 percent), and
        clustering of mission-critical databases (5.5 percent).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the top challenges Kubernetes brings to businesses?
        According to 54.5 percent of respondents, it\u2019s lack of in-house skills.
        Next are company IT structure (37.3 percent), incompatibility with legacy
        systems (32.6 percent), difficulty training users (29.7 percent), security
        and compliance concerns (24.7 percent), and integrating cloud native applications
        together (19 percent).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelsey Hightower, a developer advocate
        at Google, said of the in-house skills concern, \u201cThey don\u2019t realize
        they already have a lot of the required skills. Kubernetes is not where these
        skills originated\u2026 (These are) new terms used for older concepts. Many
        people lack confidence, because they believe that the fundamentals have changed
        somehow.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, said Alexis Richardson, founder
        and CEO of Weaveworks, \u201cWhen people worry about the basics, i.e. security,
        costs, resources, observability and configuration, this is an indication that
        they haven&#8217;t yet crossed the chasm of full enterprise adoption.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In
        a lighter note in the report, 22.5% of respondents said making coffee is the
        one thing they would like to do with K8s and currently can\u2019t. Eleven
        percent said \u201cI can do everything I need using Kubernetes\u201d, an attitude
        Richardson humorously described as \u201cKubris.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe
        report amounts to a vivid snapshot of how cloud native technologies and the
        communities around them are growing and delivering business value and where
        there is continued room for growth,\u201d said David Booth, VP of Cloud Native
        Applications at Canonical. \u201cAs an active part of the community, we\u2019re
        excited to share these insights that leverage the enormous Ubuntu user base
        as well as our proven experience working with open-source software and solving
        enterprise complexity.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> <a class=\"p-button--small p-button--positive\"

        Canonical announcing Ubuntu support for so much new hardware, the announcement
        of Ubuntu ported to a new architecture can go unnoticed. But today, we have
        a big one. Working\u00a0 with the leading <a href=\"https:\/\/riscv.org\/\">RISC-V<\/a>
        core <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sifive.com\/\">IP designer and development board
        manufacturer, SiFive<\/a>, we are proud to announce the first Ubuntu release
        for two of the most prominent SiFive boards, <a href=\"https:\/\/discourse.ubuntu.com\/t\/risc-v-on-ubuntu\/22450\">Unmatched
        and Unleashed<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>RISC-V, a new paradigm for Open Source
        hardware<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last decade, open source and open standards
        have reshaped the world we live in. Such technologies have produced long-lasting
        results and RISC-V consortium has extended open-source to develop a standard
        open-source processor architecture.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This free and open
        Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) can enable a new era of processor innovation
        through open standard collaboration with rapid industry-wide adoption. The
        architecture can be applied to a broad range of processors, from low-end microcontrollers
        to high-end server-grade processors.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SiFive and RISC-V
        International were founded with the intention of building a collaborative
        community of software and hardware innovators, all based on<a href=\"https:\/\/riscv.org\/technical\/specifications\/\">
        the RISC-V ISA<\/a>, providing a great alternative to closed-source classical
        architectures for companies with the long-term view of developing their own
        processors. It has even become a national endeavour for countries like China,
        India, and Pakistan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Consolidating reference hardware and
        software architectures<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As RISC-V gains momentum, the emerging
        industry of vendors is creating an ecosystem of products, with a pile of early
        adopters eager to begin the application development. However, there is a need
        for top-notch development systems for developers that can then be taken seamlessly
        to production.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While RISC-V enables stable reference architectures
        and hardware, running stable software on new boards can still be challenging.
        A great effort on cross-toolchain development is required, allowing the cross-compilation
        of software. The portability of applications is of great importance to move
        code to the new processor architecture.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cornerstone
        of the necessary software is the underlying Operating System (OS), which provides
        reliability and stability to the system. This demand makes the development
        on Linux even more attractive, since Linux is the most popular OS for developers
        and hobbyists, across kernel, drivers, and distributions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Open
        source initiatives are backed up by Canonical<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>At Canonical,
        we believe that open source is the best way to accelerate innovation. This
        motivates us to enable a wide range of open source communities under the Ubuntu
        umbrella. Open source software comes with its own set of challenges. Yes,
        the code can be accessed easily, but there is a gap when it comes to commercial
        deployments. What if there is a critical vulnerability (CVE) found in OSS
        used that is imperative to fix? Who provides updates with bug fixes when there
        are millions of boards out in the field? Canonical aims to position Ubuntu
        as not just the reference OS for innovators and developers, but also as the
        vehicle to enable them to take their products to market faster by letting
        them focus on their core application, without having to worry about the stability
        of the underlying frameworks. RISC-V has a lot of potential and is becoming
        a competitive ISA in multiple markets. With this premise in mind, porting
        Ubuntu to RISC-V to become the reference OS for early adopters was a no-brainer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>SiFive
        taking the lead<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sifive.com\/\">SiFive<\/a>
        (founded by the inventors of RISC-V) is one of the largest investors in RISC-V
        solutions, delivering a portfolio of commercial RISC-V products that is the
        most widely adopted in the world.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the wide
        portfolio of processor Core IP, the SiFive ecosystem of products include the
        portfolio of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sifive.com\/boards\">HiFive boards<\/a>
        based on different flavours of RISC-V processors and peripherals.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SiFive
        <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sifive.com\/boards\/hifive-unleashed\">HiFive Unleashed<\/a>

        and developers. \u201cWe are delighted to bring Ubuntu to SiFive hardware.
        Having first-class Ubuntu support enables the&nbsp; RISC-V ecosystem to scale
        fearlessly to production, with the assurance that they have access to the
        same enterprise-grade support and security as on other processor architectures.\u201d
        said Mark Shuttleworth, CEO and Founder at Canonical.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canonical\u2019s
        ability to validate and certify boards with Ubuntu provides a decisive factor
        for developers enabling them to focus on application development, feeling
        confident about platform quality and stability, including both &#8211; hardware
        and the underlying OS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Promising future<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As
        RISC-V platforms mature, there are a large number of initiatives striving
        hard to position products and provide for the increasing market demand. Canonical\u2019s
        goal is to standardise the underlying OS, providing a stable, secure Linux
        distribution for top-notch boards, helping early adopters to focus on their
        applications development and business case, and providing a reliable and out-of-the-box
        experience, followed by a path to commercial support for a successful go-to-market.
        Canonical\u2019s initiatives, including the security-hardened Ubuntu Core
        operating system, snap-based containerization and an app-based mindset to
        embedded systems, promises to smoothen the path for industrial, robotics,
        and automotive deployments as the industry moves to a 5G-enabled IoT era.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ubuntu
        on HiFive boards available now<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Three different Ubuntu images
        are now available for SiFive\u2019s HiFive boards, and more work is expected
        to include new features and a port to the latest Ubuntu releases.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>HiFive
        Unmatched is supported by <a href=\"https:\/\/cdimage.ubuntu.com\/releases\/21.04\/release\/\">Ubuntu
        21.04<\/a>. The riscv64+unmatched.img.xz image can be used on any SiFive HiFive
        Unmatched board or under qemu. The Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS will also support the
        HiFive Unmatched.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>HiFive Unleashed is supported by <a href=\"https:\/\/cdimage.ubuntu.com\/releases\/21.04\/release\/\">Ubuntu
        21.04<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/cdimage.ubuntu.com\/releases\/20.04.2\/release\/\">Ubuntu
        20.04.2 LTS<\/a>. The riscv64+unleashed.img.xz image can be used on any SiFive
        HiFive Unleashed board or under qemu.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For guidance and

        order to fully benefit from Industry 4.0, the classic boundaries between operational
        technology like machine controls, the IT world and the Internet of Things
        need to be overcome. This session will explain how Bosch Rexroth approaches
        this with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ctrlx-automation.com\/\">its new complete
        automation solution ctrlX AUTOMATION<\/a> which is based on Linux with real-time
        extension, consistently open standards, app programming technology, web-based
        engineering and a comprehensive IoT connection.<br><br>Ubuntu Core enhances
        security with strict application confinement. ctrlX AUTOMATION apps run with
        all dependencies in their snaps for increased isolation. The risk of security
        vulnerabilities is minimised as the software files packaged in snaps are unalterable.
        Machine manufacturers deploying apps benefit from automated updates for security
        fixes and patches for the lifetime of the device, without the need for engineers
        to intervene. With Ubuntu Core and snaps, software updates roll back to the
        last known working version to increase uptime and reliability on the factory
        floor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/qjmj2cy4LLA\"

        HPC DevOps<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many High Performance Computing (HPC) setups are
        still handcrafted configurations where tuning changes can take days or weeks.
        This is because the more you tune and optimise something, the more bespoke
        and unique it is, and the more unique something is, the lower the chances
        that things will just work out of the box, and HPC is no exception.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A
        new school of HPC<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now physical servers are a lot easier to
        set up, provision and configure thanks to tools such as <a href=\"https:\/\/maas.io\/\">MAAS<\/a>.
        For example, connecting servers and selecting which ones will be configured
        for networking and which for data, is as easy as clicking a button on a web
        UI. This may seem innocuous but it means that a server farm can be used for
        one project in the morning and for something completely different in the afternoon.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In
        reality, the server configuration is only the start, the base from which everything
        bubbles up. Re-configuration at the server level allows for use of higher-level
        tools such as <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/maas-2-8-new-features\">LXD
        VMs<\/a>,&nbsp; <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/kubernetes\">Kubernetes<\/a>
        and <a href=\"https:\/\/jaas.ai\/\">Juju<\/a> to quickly put together an environment
        with reusable code without needing to be a DevOps expert or having to wait
        for an expert to do it for you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we are going to
        see in the next few years is a growth of HPC with cloud native tools. Or,
        in other words, bringing cloud software tools and good developer experience
        into the world of HPC to make the operations easier.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What
        next?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A cloud-native experience in HPC is not a new idea [<a
        href=\"https:\/\/www.hpcwire.com\/solution_content\/ibm\/cross-industry\/bridging-hpc-and-cloud-native-development-with-kubernetes\/\">1<\/a>,

        but has been thrust into the limelight given the recent need for more scientific
        work being done in the fight against COVID-19. In these real-life applications
        what matters is no longer the \u2018wall time\u2019 the software takes from
        start to finish but rather the time the overall project takes to reach a practical
        conclusion, factoring in human time and operational processes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern
        cloud-native software can help with time to delivery. If you are interested

        kernel Livepatching"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/security\/livepatch\">Canonical
        livepatch<\/a> is the service and the software that enables organizations
        to quickly patch vulnerabilities on the Ubuntu Linux kernels. Livepatch provides
        uninterrupted service while reducing fire drills during high and critical
        severity kernel vulnerabilities. It is a complex technology and the details
        can be confusing, so in this post we provide a high level introduction to
        Ubuntu Linux kernel livepatching and the processes around it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Livepatch
        introduction<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When reviewing the major cybersecurity data breaches
        via web services (e.g., from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.verizon.com\/business\/resources\/reports\/dbir\/\">2021
        Verizon data breach investigations report<\/a>), one cannot but notice that
        after credential based attacks, the exploitation of vulnerabilities is the
        major attack vector.&nbsp; According to the same report, only a quarter of
        scanned organizations patch vulnerabilities in less than two months after
        being public, something that indicates that organizations are not generally
        proactive and consistent in vulnerability patching. And that\u2019s not without
        a reason; addressing vulnerabilities through unplanned work is a challenge
        as it takes the organization\u2019s focus away by creating unplanned maintenance
        windows where patches are being applied and systems are rebooted, while its
        customers or users face an unavailable service.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At
        the same time, threats do not go away; critical and high severity vulnerabilities
        can appear at arbitrary times and potentially expose important data or services.
        Canonical\u2019s vulnerability data show that 40% of high and critical severity
        vulnerabilities affect the Linux kernel, the highest of any other package.
        Addressing this vulnerability window quickly and smoothly for Ubuntu systems,
        is the goal of Canonical Livepatch. It eliminates the need for unplanned maintenance
        windows for critical and high severity kernel vulnerabilities, by patching
        the Linux kernel while the system runs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What happens
        when a kernel vulnerability is detected?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In particular, when
        Canonical detects a high or critical vulnerability on the Linux kernel we
        will create a livepatch addressing the vulnerability. After the livepatch
        is made available, it is tested in Canonical\u2019s internal server farm,
        and then promoted gradually to a series of testing tiers ensuring that any
        released livepatch has been tested sufficient time on live systems. Once the
        patch is released a <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/security\/notices\">Livepatch
        Security Notice<\/a> is issued and systems that enable the canonical-livepatch
        client will receive the patch over an authenticated channel and apply it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How
        does kernel livepatching works?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many types of vulnerabilities
        and many reasons behind them such a logic error, or a missing check in a small
        piece of code and others. On the high level the livepatch will provide new
        kernel code replacing the vulnerable one, and will update the rest of the

        principle, but also hints on why some vulnerabilities that depend on very
        complex code interactions cannot be livepatched. When a kernel vulnerability
        cannot be livepatched a<a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/security\/notices\">Livepatch
        Security Notice<\/a> is issued that advises to apply any pending kernel updates
        and reboot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How can I access the Canonical livepatch<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Canonical
        livepatch is available through Ubuntu Advantage and Ubuntu Pro to organizations
        and customers that would like to take advantage of Canonical\u2019s security
        features. Beyond that, as Ubuntu\u2019s mission is to bring free software
        to the widest audience, we enable developers and individuals to access Canonical
        livepatch through the free subscription. The free subscription allows for
        up to 3 machines and up to 50 for Ubuntu community members.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0[<a

        to enable Canonical livepatch<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Canonical livepatch can be enabled
        in two steps; First obtain your subscription token via the<a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/pro\">
        Ubuntu Advantage portal<\/a>. The first step is necessary for both free subscription
        and Ubuntu Advantage users, but it is not necessary on Ubuntu Pro. Then you
        will need to install the canonical-livepatch client and enable it. The steps
        are:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>$ sudo ua attach [TOKEN]\n\n$

        Server Conflict Detection"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>This blog title should
        really be, &#8220;<strong>Why you always, always, always want conflict detection
        turned on on all the networks MAAS touches<\/strong>,&#8221; but that&#8217;s
        really long as a title.  But hear me out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As promised, here
        is another DHCP blog, this time explaining how you can have multiple DHCP
        servers on the same subnet, serving overlapping IP addresses.  There are a
        lot of network-savvy people who will tell you that serving the same set of
        IP addresses from two different DHCP servers just won&#8217;t work.  While
        that&#8217;s a really good rule to follow, it isn&#8217;t totally accurate
        under all conditions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Keeping it &#8220;loosely coupled&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some
        DHCP implementations offer a feature called <em>server conflict detection<\/em>.  In
        short, DHCP SCD uses ICMP Echo messages (pings) &#8212; with an appropriate
        wait time &#8212; to see if an IP address is in use before trying to lease
        it to a client.  If all the DHCP servers on a given subnet have SCD enabled,
        you don&#8217;t have to worry about whether the DHCP server scopes overlap.  You
        can assign whatever set of IP addresses you want to whichever DHCP server,
        and they will work together without addressing errors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&#8217;s
        really surprising about this feature? Well, in RFC 2131, ping checks are <em>recommended<\/em>
        on both ends, by the DHCP server and the client:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>As
        a consistency check, the allocating server SHOULD probe the reused address
        before allocating the address, e.g., with an ICMP echo request, and the client
        SHOULD probe the newly received address, e.g., with ARP.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        capital letters there came from the spec itself.  Essentially, DHCP servers
        really should check to make sure the addresses they send out aren&#8217;t
        already in use &#8212; and clients that get them should make sure they&#8217;re
        actually free before they use them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From an architectural perspective,
        it might make more sense for DHCP servers to be enabled to talk to each other
        and coordinate assignment of IP addresses.  It is possible to build and configure
        such DHCP servers &#8212; but that type of coordination isn&#8217;t really
        in keeping with the fundamental operation of DHCP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a protocol,
        DHCP is designed to be loosely coupled.  Specifically, any client that has
        the DHCP protocol stack can discover any DHCP server or servers; any server
        can make an offer; and a client can take whichever offer it wants (though
        it&#8217;s typically coded to take the first DHCP offer that it can accept).  Keeping
        that loosely-coupled architecture intact means letting DHCP servers check
        to see if the address they&#8217;re sending is in use before offering it,
        and letting clients check to see if an IP address is in use before they request
        to accept the offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The value for MAAS<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s
        no exact count, but it&#8217;s fair to say that a very large number of MAAS
        installation and configuration issues resolve around competing DHCP servers,
        that is, multiple DHCP servers on the same subnet, using the same scope (or
        overlapping scopes), colliding with each other and preventing machines from
        getting IP addresses.  This collision usually shows up as an ability to power
        on a machine, but not to commission it, since it can&#8217;t manage to complete
        the process of getting an IP address via DHCP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>MAAS already
        has some conflict detection built in, as documented in <a href=\"https:\/\/maas.io\/docs\/deb\/3.0\/cli\/managing-dhcp#heading--resolving-ip-conflicts\">Managing
        DHCP<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>In some cases,
        MAAS manages a subnet that is not empty, which could  result in MAAS assigning
        a duplicate IP address.  MAAS is capable of  detecting IPs in use on a subnet.  Be
        aware that there are two caveats<\/p><p>1. If a previously-assigned NIC is
        in a quiescent state or turned off, MAAS may not detect it before duplicating
        an IP address. <br>2. At least one rack controller must have access to the
        IP-assigned machine in order for this feature to work.  <\/p><p>MAAS also
        recognises when the subnet ARP cache is full, so that it can re-check the
        oldest IPs added to the cache to search for free IP  addresses.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If
        you want your configuration to run more smoothly, it&#8217;s useful to enable
        SCD on every DHCP provider on your network.  It doesn&#8217;t hurt anything,
        and it really doesn&#8217;t cost that much (beside a little extra delay when
        assigning addresses). There are plenty of network issues associated with a
        large, bare-metal network.  There&#8217;s no reason why DHCP conflicts need
        to be one of those issues.<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This

        one DHCP server on the same network and still have everything work right,
        with no conflicts and no dropped packets or IP requests.  It&#8217;s really
        not that hard to pull together, either, but there are some things to know,
        and some things to consider before we investigate that situation.  For this
        blog, we&#8217;ll put some of the overlooked facets of DHCP in <strong>bold
        text<\/strong>. Let&#8217;s take a look.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A deep look at DHCP<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DHCP
        is, technically, a network management protocol.  In other words, it&#8217;s
        part of a collection of hardware and software tools that help to manage network
        traffic. DHCP is designed to automatically assign IP addresses <strong>and
        other communication parameters, such as default gateway, domain name, name
        server IPs, or time server IPs<\/strong> to clients.  There are (at least)
        two participants in a DHCP transaction: a server and a client, but the client
        has to meet some requirements to participate.  Specifically, <strong>the client
        has to implement an instance of the DHCP protocol stack<\/strong>; without
        that, it has no idea how to formulate Discovery and Request packets, nor can
        it recognise Offers or Acknowledgements (or NAKs, for that matter).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For
        what it&#8217;s worth, the &#8220;DHCP protocol stack&#8221; just means that
        a device can handle at least the following standard message types:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>DHCPDiscover:
        a broadcast message sent in the hopes of finding a DHCP server. &nbsp;Note
        that <strong>clients that don&#8217;t get a DHCP response may be able to  assign
        themselves an Automatic Private IPv4 address (APIPA), which should always
        be in the range 169.254.0.0\/16<\/strong>.  This is good to know, because
        you want to pretty much<em> always<\/em> leave that <em>scope<\/em> (that
        range of IP addresses) unused by anything else in your system.<\/li><li>DHCPOffer:
        also a broadcast message, one that offers an IPv4 address lease; the lease
        is more than just an IP address, as we saw in the <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/basic-dhcp-concepts\">last
        DHCP blog<\/a>. <\/li><li>DHCPRequest: If you haven&#8217;t noticed by now,
        DHCP exchanges are little like rolling snowballs: they pick up more protocol
        information as they go and keep it for the duration of the transaction, sending
        it back and forth.  In this case, the client sends back everything the DHCP
        server sent, along with a request to actually take the offered lease.<\/li><li>DHCPAcknowlegement:
        If everything matches up when the DHCP server gets the Request, it responds
        with an Acknowledgement, which basically says, &#8220;Okay, you can lease
        this IP address for a set period of time.&#8221;<\/li><li>DHCPNak: If the
        client waits too long to Request an Offer (generally, if a different server
        has already claimed the offered IP address), the DHCP server may respond with
        a Nak.  This requires the client to start over again at Discover.<\/li><li>DHCPDecline:
        If the client determines that, for some reason, the Offer has a configuration
        that won&#8217;t work for it, it can Decline the offer &#8212; that this also
        means it has to start again at Discover.<\/li><li>DHCPRelease: When a client
        is done with an IP address, it can send a Release message to cancel the rest
        of the lease and return the IP address to the server&#8217;s available pool.<\/li><li>DHCPInform:
        This is a relatively new message, which allows a client that <em>already has<\/em>
        an IP address to easily get other configuration parameters (related to that
        IP address) from a DHCP server.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As you may recall from
        the previous blog, the normal DHCP sequence is often referred to as DORA for
        &#8220;Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge,&#8221; which is what happens
        when everything goes right the first time.  Note that, <strong>shortly before
        a lease expires, most DHCP clients will renew the lease, often with a shortened
        form of the exchange (Request\/Acknowledge) which does not require a full
        DORA exchange.  Also, this renewal exchange takes place directly between the
        client and the DHCP server, rather than being broadcast across the entire
        network<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Address allocation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There
        are (at least) three ways that a DHCP server can assign addresses to requesting
        clients:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Manual or static allocation essentially means
        that the client receives a specifically-chosen IP address, or, at a minimum,
        keeps the first one that it&#8217;s assigned until the client decides to release
        it.  <\/li><li>Dynamic allocation means that a DHCP server assigns IP addresses
        from an available pool (scope) of addresses, which can change to another available
        address in that scope at any time, depending on the network dynamics. <\/li><li><strong>Automatic
        allocation is sort of a cross between the other two types.  The DHCP server
        assigns an address from its defined scope, but then remembers which client
        got what address, and re-assigns that address to the same client when a new
        request is made<\/strong>.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of the allocation
        method, the DHCP server&#8217;s scope &#8212; its range of IP addresses that
        it controls (and can assign) &#8212; is something that must be user-configured.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A
        UDP exchange<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>DHCP is  &#8220;connectionless,&#8221; meaning
        that basically everything takes place via UDP, usually by broadcast packets
        &#8212; that is, packets <em>not<\/em> overtly addressed to a specific device.  As
        we saw in the last blog, the messages become targeted pretty quickly, using
        the payload to specify the IP address of the DHCP server and the MAC address
        of the requesting client, to avoid requiring every other device on the network
        to completely decode every DHCP message.  Note that <strong>it is possible
        to target a UDP packet at a specific server, by choosing a unicast message
        type<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Scope, allocation, topology, and authority<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A
        DHCP client can request its previous IP address, if it had one, but whether
        it gets that address or not depends on four things: scope, allocation, topology,
        and authority.  Specifically:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The larger the DHCP server&#8217;s
        scope of addresses, the more likely it is that the requested address will
        be available again.<\/li><li>The chances of getting the same IP address again
        also depend on how the server is allocating addresses (see above).  Static
        allocation guarantees the same address; automatic allocation makes it very
        likely; with dynamic allocation, it&#8217;s impossible to predict.<\/li><li>Topology
        also plays into this process: if the DHCP server is using one or more DHCP
        relays to get some or all of its addresses, the chances of re-using the same
        IP address go down.<\/li><li>Authority also affects the probability.  <strong>An
        authoritative DHCP server will definitely answer any unanswered DHCPDiscover
        message, but that server is pulling only from its own scope<\/strong>.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So
        now that we have a few of these odds and ends down pat, let&#8217;s consider
        the situation when multiple DHCP servers operate on one network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Multiple
        DHCP servers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With regard to multiple DHCP servers on the same
        network, there are three possible scopes to consider:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Overlapping
        scopes:  In this situation, more than one server can offer the same IP address.  There
        <em>is<\/em> a way to make this work, by setting up the DHCP servers to talk
        to one another, but for most applications, this configuration can be avoided.  We&#8217;ll
        discuss DHCP servers with overlapping scopes in the next DHCP blog.<\/li><li>Adjacent
        scopes: In this configuration, IP addresses are assigned from portions of
        the same subnet.  For example, one server might control scope 192.168.14.2
        &#8211; 192.168.14.187, and another server might manage scope 192.168.14.200
        &#8211; 192.168.14.247.  This is the most common (and most reliable) setup
        for multiple DHCP servers.<\/li><li>Heterogeneous scopes: This arrangement
        basically has DHCP servers on different subnets, such as 192.168.14.2 &#8211;
        .253 for one server, and 10.17.22.3 &#8211; .98 for the other.  This can be
        made to work, but it&#8217;s <em>extremely<\/em> difficult to set up and not
        so easy to manage.  We&#8217;ll also cover this outlier in the next blog.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So
        essentially, we&#8217;ve narrowed down our focus to the most obvious and reliable
        use case, adjacent DHCP scopes.  But how do the two servers work together
        to manage DHCP requests?  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Remember, connectionless<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well,
        the answer is, &#8220;they don&#8217;t.&#8221;  The servers and clients operate
        independently on a first-come, first-served basis.  A client makes a DHCPRequest.  One
        or both of the servers may answer, depending on load and spare IP addresses.  It&#8217;s
        also possible that neither will answer, because they&#8217;re both out of
        IP addresses, but with good network planning &#8212; and making one of those
        servers authoritative &#8212; those situations will be kept to a minimum or
        eliminated entirely.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If no servers answer, we may be looking
        at the APIPA situation, if that&#8217;s possible in the network.  If one server
        answers, it&#8217;s a standard DORA exchange, as if there <em>were<\/em> only
        one server.  If two servers answer, it&#8217;s the question of which Offer
        the client gets first.  Remember that the Offer messages contain the DHCP
        server&#8217;s address in the payload.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Clarity is sometimes
        power<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, the foregoing discussion helped to clear
        up some potentially confusing things about DHCP in a more complex network
        environment.  We&#8217;ll tackle the more difficult cases in the next DHCP
        blog, and then we&#8217;ll move on to some detailed examples.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s

        with the rest of the React app. As far as the progress goes, our dashboard,

        this two week iteration, we focused on exposing the cloning API to the UI,
        where we want to allow MAAS users to clone network and\/or storage configurations
        from a source machine to multiple destination machines. We worked through
        a few explorations of interaction design to figure out how this could fit
        with the current workflow. Here is our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.figma.com\/proto\/krHkPyCmE5MttzCRTUhJIT\/%5B21.10%5D-Cloning-UI?node-id=0%3A3&amp;frame-preset-name=Desktop&amp;scaling=contain&amp;page-id=0%3A1\">first
        prototype of the new cloning UI<\/a>, if you want to try it out.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        overall flow starts at selecting destination machines. When a user selects
        multiple machines, they have an option to clone the networking and\/or the
        storage configurations from a source machine into the selected destination
        machines.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/UwzG2w0B0Fq7e43BU3FQiykXDyfl11LPvKS5e510lPAHPKwfTXAqK4ca2GhqrVTadEBBPBA7LZThqOk93cy72kmod_DUjIOwaHcHjJQ4VPhnC7O-6bgbZa7WzUbCSOteo30pHi_4\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In this workflow, we assume that our users
        would already know which source machine they want to clone from and that cloning
        will work with a homogeneous hardware environment.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure
        class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/bvJ1FoD_-3gOmEKzRoHzYJnlLdOMIqh5yn9RiImOWw47FFAoZ2bryrGqCWz8ZAZPWamJ1zm2MlVHOx3TwSp2OXYATMin58Ulba-6me_i0xwSyBapbwLtt_w5alYoU87aywOYz_k6\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can either clone the storage or network
        configuration from the source machine to the destination machine or both!
        Since our assumption is that you would already have an idea of which source
        machine you want to clone from, the search function allows you to search by
        hostname or system id. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be able to successfully clone
        machines, the source and destination machines need to be in one of the following
        states: failed testing, allocated, or ready. In addition, the user needs to
        have admin permission on all machines that the cloning will be performed on.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the source machine is selected from the
        drop-down list, you will see a brief summary of the source machine, including
        the network and storage information. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img

        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the cloning process is complete, we will
        report the number of successful machines and error machines, allowing you
        to either select other machines to clone or inform why the cloning process
        failed.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the more common mistakes is to clone
        machines with different disk sizes. In our current API, if the destination
        machine has a smaller disk size than the source machine, cloning will not
        be successful. The same mental model goes for block devices as well. Other
        errors that can occur includes, selecting machines with unmatched boot methods
        and unmatching networking interfaces.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Showing IP
        addresses in the UI network card<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We received a <a href=\"https:\/\/bugs.launchpad.net\/maas\/+bug\/1927106\">bug
        report<\/a> that the IP address should be surfaced to the network summary
        card because it is one of the most important pieces of information regarding
        the Network tab of a machine in MAAS. However, we were not showing that information
        in the network card in the Summary section.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it
        looked like the IP address was way more relevant than the MAC address, MAC
        address and DHCP were very important in an enterprise-level MAAS and cannot
        be eliminated from the Network card and we cannot disregard that, especially,
        for debugging purposes.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that in mind, we initially
        looked for a way to switch between both of them, MAC addresses and IP addresses,
        since space matters in this kind of card.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The final
        decision, nonetheless, was to show both. In addition, we took this opportunity
        to enrich the table and include more information from the Network tab, like
        subnet and VLAN.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/344doIfVH1WVzFTcXa2xhjl32QeL8CKyVfybjg_uR8Ve_eOo66zBjRrNanKFo0uuVkL0Gnsp52HwE7Mx1XcK8i0lACnA31I9i1W2zkrO-x2k4HZpBomaqugqYOBq4wqLgy7OhQBG\"

        Framework<\/a> earlier this year.  It&#8217;s been on our roadmap to shift
        MAAS doc to this cool new way of explaining things.  This cycle, we plan to
        make it happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>You&#8217;d think it would be obvious&#8230;.
        <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Di\u00e1taxis is one of <em>those<\/em> ideas.  Once you
        see it, you can&#8217;t figure out why everybody didn&#8217;t come up with
        this system.   This framework divides documentation up into four buckets:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Explanations<\/li><li>How-to
        guides<\/li><li>Tutorials<\/li><li>Reference material<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When
        writing, one shouldn&#8217;t mix the buckets.  You should take the time to
        view the material for yourself &#8212; it will definitely help you document
        your own systems better. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorting the MAAS documentation into
        these buckets requires some clear delimiters.  We&#8217;re currently taking
        a liberal approach, but here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve come up with so far:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>Explanations<\/em>
        assume that the reader is familiar with common technical terms, like &#8220;DHCP&#8221;
        or &#8220;network bonding.&#8221;  These sections will only explain MAAS terminology,
        features, usage, and nuances.<\/li><li><em>How-to guides<\/em> should be a
        little more than just steps. We&#8217;ve tried these guides a bit with MAAS
        3.0, discovering that it&#8217;s possible to make them <em>too<\/em> sparse.  We&#8217;ll
        keep a reasonable amount of compact explanation in these sections, so that
        you don&#8217;t have to consult the explanations too often.<\/li><li><em>Tutorials<\/em>
        will be full-on, newbie explanations, probably tiered with detail sections
        that let you skip the most basic topics, if desired.  These will most likely
        be added to the Tutorial link, which is separate from the documentation.<\/li><li><em>Reference
        material<\/em> should allow us to unburden a lot of the more technical pages
        of long, complicated listings and tables (think &#8220;commissioning scripts&#8221;
        and &#8220;power types,&#8221; for example).  Since the documentation is a
        hyperlinked medium, it&#8217;s only legwork to link the various technical
        details from a reference page to the other types of material.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Along
        the way, we also plan to simplify the navigation column on the left-hand side
        of the docs page.   Our main issues there are: (1) that the objects in the
        navigation aren&#8217;t all objects; (2) that they aren&#8217;t the same kinds
        of objects; and (3) that the navigation structures aren&#8217;t parallel constructs,
        which is <em>really<\/em> important for headings and lists.  Readers have
        trouble finding context if you group things that aren&#8217;t parallel, like
        this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Clean the garage.<\/li><li>There&#8217;s some mail
        lying on the counter that I don&#8217;t know what to do with.<\/li><li>What
        is all that stuff in the back of the fridge?<\/li><li>Dinner is at Suzie&#8217;s
        at eight.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, our current menu has, over time,
        organically become like that overgrown to-do list.  Time to fix that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Speaking
        of context<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By implementing Di\u00e1taxis, we&#8217;re hoping
        to improve the flow of documentation, which is just another way of saying
        that we don&#8217;t want to constantly change the reader&#8217;s context.  In
        this case, context refers specifically to a mindset or a level of focus.  Much
        computer documentation is terrible about pushing the reader&#8217;s context
        all over the place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you&#8217;re focused on
        following some steps to create a new virtual machine and deploy it, you&#8217;re
        in what might be called a &#8220;get-it-done&#8221; context.  You don&#8217;t
        want to have to read a detailed explanation of how something works when only
        about five percent of that deep reading is even important to you right now.  And
        you don&#8217;t want to view a long list or table of things you <em>could<\/em>
        do.  What you want at this moment is a set of concrete steps to get you from
        A to B, with just enough explanation to keep you from tripping over the setup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On
        the other hand, when you&#8217;re in deep reading mode, you may or may not
        be sitting right by the system, and you may or may not want to try every operation
        before reading on.  That type of discussion is more tutorial in nature.  Similarly,
        when you <em>do<\/em> want to look at that long list of parameters, you&#8217;d
        like to avoid four-page, rambling, technical explanations of every possible
        nuance related to something that might be related to those parameters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In
        other words, if we change your context too many times, you&#8217;ll stop reading
        and just try something.  When that doesn&#8217;t work, you may scan the doc
        again once or twice, but pretty soon, you&#8217;ll be on our <a href=\"https:\/\/discourse.maas.io\/\">MAAS
        discourse<\/a> page, asking for someone to decode it all for you.   There&#8217;s
        nothing wrong with MAAS discourse &#8212; it&#8217;s a great forum, and lately,
        one of our team members is always tasked with patrolling it as a top priority.  But
        around eighty-five percent of your information needs <em>should<\/em> be met
        by the documentation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the latest from the MAAS
        doc world.  You&#8217;re welcome to comment with your thoughts on documentation
        structure and format.  <br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We

        of MAAS 3.0. This release provides some new features and bug fixes.  Here&#8217;s
        the <strong>tl;dr<\/strong> summary:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>PCI and USB devices
        are now modelled in MAAS<\/li><li>PCI and USB device tabs are now available
        in machine details<\/li><li>IBM Z DPM partitions are supported for MAAS and
        virtual machines<\/li><li>Proxmox is now supported<\/li><li>LXD projects are

        MAAS CLI help, the status bar, and the presentation of logs and events<\/li><li>RSD
        pod support has been removed<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a close
        look at some of these changes, in no particular order.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>API
        changes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the advent of MAAS 3.0, we are removing support
        for RSD pods. Registered pods and their machines will be removed by MAAS upon
        upgrading to MAAS 3.0.  Since we support semantic versioning for MAAS, this
        change prompted us to move to MAAS 3.0 (rather than issuing a 2.10 release,
        e.g.).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Consolidation of logs and events<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        logs and events tabs have combined and now live under \u201cLogs\u201d. In
        addition to a number of small improvements, navigating and displaying events
        has been made easier. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Downloading logs<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A
        helpful new feature is the ability to download the machine and installation
        output.  If a machine has failed deployment, you can now download a full tar
        of the curtain logs. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This change should make it easier to
        report bugs, as well, using the new bug reporting process defined during the
        3.0 development cycle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New bug reporting instructions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>MAAS
        bugs are still reported via Launchpad, as always.  Filing a good bug report,
        thought, makes all the difference in how quickly we  can triage and address
        your problem.  The new <a href=\"https:\/\/maas.io\/docs\/report-a-bug\">how-to
        guide<\/a> will walk  you through the key steps of filing a usable bug:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a
        href=\"https:\/\/maas.io\/docs\/report-a-bug#heading--concise-summary\">Prepare
        a concise summary<\/a>\n<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/maas.io\/docs\/report-a-bug#heading--version-and-build\">Identify
        your version and build first<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/maas.io\/docs\/report-a-bug#heading--which-interface\">Explain
        whether you\u2019re using the UI, CLI, or API<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/maas.io\/docs\/report-a-bug#heading--what-happens\">Explain
        what happens<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/maas.io\/docs\/report-a-bug#heading--reproducing-your-issue\">Explain
        how to reproduce your issue<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/maas.io\/docs\/report-a-bug#heading--screenshots\">Take
        screenshots, if relevant<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/maas.io\/docs\/report-a-bug#heading--logfiles\">Locate
        and capture logfiles, if at all possible<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We encourage
        you to follow these guidelines, as much as it makes sense, so that we can
        more quickly address your issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Disabling boot methods<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Individual
        boot methods may now be disabled. When a boot method is disabled, MAAS will
        configure MAAS controlled isc-dhcpd to not respond to the associated boot
        architecture code. Note that external DHCP servers must be configured manually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To
        allow different boot methods to be in different states on separate physical
        networks &#8212; using the same VLAN ID configuration &#8212; you must make
        the changes on the subnet in the UI or API. When using the API, boot methods
        to be disabled may be specified using the MAAS internal name or boot architecture
        code in octet or hex form. For example, the following command will disable

        VM host during deployment<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When deploying a machine through
        the API, it\u2019s now possible to specify:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">register_vmhost=True
        <\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>to have LXD configured on the machine and registered as

        is provided.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>PCI and USB devices are now modelled in MAAS<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>MAAS
        3.0 models all PCI and USB devices detected during commissioning:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Existing
        machines will have to be recommissioned to have PCI and USB devices modelled<\/li><li>
        PCI and USB devices are shown in the UI and on the API using the node-devices

        the API using the allocate operation on the machines endpoint a machine may
        allocated by a device vendor_id, product_id, vendor_name, product_name, or
        commissioning_driver.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>IBM Z DPM partition support<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Partitions
        hosted on IBM Z14 GA2 (LinuxONE II) and newer in DPM mode are now supported
        by MAAS 3.0. Note that partitions (LPARs) must be pre-configured, must use
        qeth based network devices (like Hipersockets or OSA adapters) and must have
        properly-defined (FCP) storage groups. IBM Z DPM partitions can be added as
        a chassis, which allows you to add multiple partitions at once<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Proxmox
        support<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>MAAS 3.0 supports Proxmox as a power driver:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Only
        Proxmox VMs are supported<\/li><li>You may authenticate with Proxmox using
        a username and password or a username and API token<\/li><li>If an API token
        is used, it must be given permission to query, start and stop VMs.<\/li><li>Proxmox
        VMs can be added as a chassis; this allows you to add all VMs in Proxmox at
        once.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that proxmox support has also been back-ported
        to MAAS 2.9<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>LXD projects support<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>MAAS 3.0
        supports the use of LXD projects:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>LXD VM hosts registered
        in MAAS are now tied to a specific LXD project which MAAS uses to manage VMs<\/li><li>MAAS

        to commission the machine if no devices are detected<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Workload
        annotations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Workload annotations have been added to the machine
        summary page in MAAS 3.0. These allow you to apply <strong>owner_data<\/strong>
        to a machine and make it visible while the machine is in allocated or deployed
        state:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/admin.insights.ubuntu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/82b2\/blog-2021-07-06-3.png\"

        once the machine state changes to something other than \u201callocated\u201d
        or \u201cdeployed.\u201d The machine list can be filtered by these workload
        annotations. MAAS will warn you on the release page to remind you that workload
        annotations will be cleared upon releasing the machine<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fixed
        status bar<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In MAAS 3.0, a fixed status bar has been added
        to the bottom of the screen, which will always display the MAAS name and version
        on the left. The right side of the status bar is intended to show contextual
        data, depending on the UI panel currently displayed. For now, the only data
        shown is a \u201clast commissioned\u201d timestamp when the user is on a machine

        computing workloads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using cost effective open source private
        cloud infrastructure and placing workloads on public clouds with considerations
        for application performance, security and compliance,&nbsp; economics and
        consumption model shall allow financial institutions to optimise their CapEx
        and OpEx costs.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenStack is the de-facto standard for
        open source private cloud build. OpenStack sits at the centre of the open
        source infrastructure stack, providing an interface for the virtualisation
        stack, SDN and SDS. It allows provisioning VMs on-demand from the self-service
        portal and allocates the required resources through the underlying platforms
        all managed and provisioned through APIs with common authentication mechanisms.
        <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond standard infrastructure-as-a-service functionality,
        OpenStack provides additional open source components for orchestration, fault
        management and service management amongst other services to ensure high availability
        of enterprise applications.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>OpenStack for financial services<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenStack
        provides a complete ecosystem for building private clouds. Built from multiple
        sub-projects as a modular system, OpenStack allows financial institutions
        to build out a <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/financial-services\">scalable
        private (or hybrid) cloud architecture<\/a> that is based on open standards.
        <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenStack enables application portability among private and
        public clouds, allowing financial institutions to choose the best cloud for
        their applications and workflows at any time, without lock-in. It can also
        be integrated with a variety of key business systems such as Active Directory
        and LDAP.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenStack software provides a solution for delivering
        infrastructure as a service (IaaS) to end users through a web portal and provides
        a foundation for layering on additional cloud management tools. These tools
        can be used to implement higher levels of automation and to integrate analytics-driven
        management applications for optimizing cost, utilization and service levels.
        <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenStack software provides support for improving service
        levels across all workloads and for taking advantage of the high availability
        capabilities built into cloud aware applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Charmed
        OpenStack<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/openstack\">Charmed
        OpenStack<\/a> is an enterprise grade OpenStack distribution that leverages
        <a href=\"https:\/\/maas.io\/\">MAAS<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/juju.is\/\">Juju<\/a>,
        and the OpenStack charmed operators to simplify the deployment and management
        of an OpenStack cloud.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canonical\u2019s Charmed OpenStack ensures
        private cloud price-performance, providing full automation around OpenStack
        deployments and operations. Together with Ubuntu, it meets the highest security,
        stability and quality standards in the industry.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frictionless
        open source cloud infrastructure<br><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenStack gives financial
        institutions the ability to seamlessly move workloads from one cloud to another,
        whether private or public. It also accelerates time-to-market by giving financial
        institutions\u2019 business units, a self-service portal to access necessary
        resources on-demand, and an API driven platform for developing cloud-aware
        apps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One does need to acknowledge that OpenStack is a growing
        software ecosystem consisting of various interconnected components. In order
        to provide a frictionless open source private cloud infrastructure to financial
        institutions, Canonical offers fully managed services so that finservs can
        focus on building innovative applications and not worry about infrastructure
        build and maintenance. Canonical\u2019s managed OpenStack provides 24\u00d77
        cloud monitoring, daily maintenance, regular software updates, OpenStack upgrades
        and more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/financial-services\">We

        app is an app is an app. But in the world of Linux, things are a little more
        nuanced. Take VLC as an example. The software may be packaged ever so slightly
        differently in various Linux distribution archives, even different releases
        of the same distribution &#8211; the av01 codec is an interesting use case
        in this regard. Then, software may also be packaged as a snap. Due to their
        security containment and bundling of necessary dependencies, snaps can behave
        or look differently to their classic RPM or Deb counterparts. As a publisher,
        you want to make sure that your users get a consistent look &amp; feel, regardless
        of the target platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this blog post, we\u2019d like to
        highlight several ways you can ensure your users get the best visual experience
        with snaps. While there may still be outstanding issues with specific aspects
        of desktop usage, the tips and tricks today should help narrow that gap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>It\u2019s
        a matter of style<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>We already talked about the <a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/blog\/snaps-and-themes-on-the-path-to-seamless-desktop-integration\">snap
        theming roadmap<\/a> toward the end of 2020. The project aims to simplify
        and automate the usage of visual elements in snaps. It also provides a template
        for how developers and publishers can include their own custom assets as parts
        during the snap build process. If you want to make sure your snap has a distinct
        style, you can add the necessary icons, themes, or other elements inside the
        snap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">...<br>parts:<br>\u00a0
        theme:<br>\u00a0 \u00a0 plugin: dump<br>\u00a0 \u00a0 # downloaded from https:\/\/www.gnome-look.org\/p\/1309630\/<br>\u00a0
        \u00a0 source: .\/TraditionalHumanized.tar.gz<br>\u00a0 \u00a0 organize:<br>\u00a0
        \u00a0 \u00a0 gtk-*: share\/themes\/TraditionalHumanized\/<br>\u00a0 \u00a0
        stage:<br>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - share\/themes\/*\/gtk-*<br>...<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>But
        it is also possible you may not want to use any custom assets, and you just
        want the snap to integrate well into the desktop. Today, the easiest way to
        accomplish that is by using one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/blog\/the-expandables-snapcraft-extensions-and-the-secret-code\">supported
        desktop extensions<\/a> in the snap build process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Extend,
        Embrace, Snap<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept of snapcraft extensions was introduced
        to help developers achieve faster, more consistent results with their snaps.
        Behind the scenes, the extensions abstractize a number of common declarations
        and reusable building blocks, making sure the developers can build their snaps
        quickly and successfully.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, the desktop-focused extensions
        like GNOME, KDE and Flutter can significantly improve the overall experience.
        For instance, the <a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/docs\/gnome-3-38-extension\">GNOME
        3.38 extension<\/a> will automatically configure a number of interface connections,
        various environment variables necessary for the build step and runtime, layout
        sets, and commonly used library dependencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">apps:<br>&nbsp;
        &nbsp; tali:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; extensions: [gnome-3-38]<br>&nbsp;
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; command: usr\/bin\/tali<br>...<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Quite
        importantly, the use of the extension will also make sure that snaps correctly
        use the necessary visual assets, like themes, and that snaps will respond
        correctly to look &amp; feel changes in the system. The solution is not perfect
        at the moment, and there may be scenarios where the results differ from the
        Deb or RPM versions of the app on the system. However, the extensions go a
        long way toward mitigating the discrepancies in the visual experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>End
        users can also choose their own themes<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases, some
        of your installed snaps may simply not be able to utilize the existing development
        features in the snap ecosystem. For example, snaps built years back predate
        the concept of extensions, and most likely do not have them declared in their
        snapcraft.yaml, and consequently, do not use some of the recent improvements
        introduced through the extensions. However, you can manually instruct any
        which snap to use any available theme on your host &#8211; even different
        themes for different snaps, if you like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the GNOME desktop,
        you can run something like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">GTK_THEME=Adwaita:dark
        snap run gnome-system-monitor<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Plasma desktop, you
        can use the QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE environment variable. The value must be set
        to an existing, valid style available in the desktop. For instance:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=igor snap run vlc<br>VLC
        media player 3.0.14 Vetinari (revision 3.0.14-0-g41878ff4f2)<br>QApplication:
        invalid style override ''igor'' passed, ignoring it.<br>Available styles:
        Breeze, Windows, Fusion<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>You can then create your own shortcuts
        or application launchers, which will then launch the snaps styled how you
        need it, whether matching the system theme, or a different setup you desire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You
        can also use other environment variables, like say QT_SCALE_FACTOR or GDK_SCALE
        to configure either fractional HD display scaling factor on smaller devices,
        in case your snaps are not rendered the same size as their classic counterparts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Summary<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Nailing
        the perfect look &amp; feel for Linux applications is not an easy task, snaps
        notwithstanding. Things become even more complicated with self-contained,
        standalone application formats like snap, due to security confinement and
        isolation from the underlying system. However, there are ways the publishers
        &#8211; and users &#8211; can make things better. On the development side,
        desktop extensions can massively help standardize and improve the consistency
        of looks for snaps. Alternatively, the developers can also bundle their own
        visual assets with their applications, or provide them as separate snaps.
        The users can also manually override styles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019d like
        to hear from you &#8211; the more you tell us why something isn\u2019t working
        as well as you believe it should, the more we can take that feedback into
        account, and improve the snap ecosystem. The best way to do that is to join
        <a href=\"https:\/\/forum.snapcraft.io\/\">our forum<\/a>, and let us know
        your thoughts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Photo by <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@schaidler?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">John

        IT services are widely used by the most sophisticated organisations across
        the globe. Recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.co.kearney.com\/leadership-change-organization\/article?\/a\/launching-the-next-generation-of-business-process-outsourcing\">reports<\/a>
        show that over 90% of the Fortune 500 have multiple outsourcing contracts
        to managed service providers, with a value of over $190 billion. This includes
        managed IT services such cloud services, infrastructure, networks, security,
        backup, applications and much more. How can organisations at any scale adopt
        the same strategy and benefit from managed IT services? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What
        does \u201cIT\u201d look like in a Fortune 500?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At a
        scale of a Fortune 500 organisation, things look different than the usual.
        Running a business with hundreds of thousands of employees in different regions
        across the world, with millions of daily activities to serve thousands of
        customers and generate billions of dollars in revenues can easily become complicated.
        It requires well structured operations to run a business at that enormous
        scale, where any activity that does not add value should be minimised, automated
        or even eliminated when possible.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These companies have
        always created better alternatives to enhance the way they do everyday business.
        Normally, an IT department at that scale would serve hundreds of thousands
        of daily users, with each user group having their own set of required applications
        and services that help them do their jobs. A minor issue causing a few seconds
        of delay in a widely used service within the company would cost over a 100K
        seconds of waste, or almost 3 working days of a full time equivalent! The
        mass makes minimal things count, and a few minutes everyday throughout the
        year is a significant amount of lost potential worth acting upon. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"274\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As
        the technology evolves really fast, these organisations are typically early
        adopters. Being at the high end of new technology allows them to stay ahead
        of competition and maintain their leadership. They\u2019re always looking
        for accelerated adoption of new technologies, without adding a technical debt
        to their operations. Managed IT services have created a reliable alternative
        for them to minimise costs, reduce complexity and achieve their benefits from
        new technologies.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How are managed IT services consumed
        at that scale?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A few decades ago, worldwide leading enterprises
        started outsourcing more &#8220;non-core&#8221; operations to managed service
        providers (MSPs).  This applies to almost all functions within the organisation
        including transportation, facility management, advertising, operations and
        even HR. This approach allowed organisations to build business-centric operations
        across the company focused on adding value and contributing to the business
        goals. Non-strategic tasks, especially ones that require a specific expertise,
        would be cheaper and more efficient to outsource. The bottom line here is
        that &#8220;keeping the lights on&#8221; is never strategic! <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A
        recent Gartner <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/publications\/cio-top-priorities-leadership-vision-2021\">report<\/a>
        shows that the biggest challenges facing CIOs in 2021 are insufficient skills
        and technical debt. Managed IT services helped offload a big portion of complex
        operations and minimised the skill gap within these organisations. This helped
        in cutting down costs while providing the required skills and redundancy at
        a fraction of the hiring budget. An MSP is usually capable of hiring world
        class specialists in their specific domains as they can easily utilise their
        expertise to serve multiple customers. This exposure to multiple environments
        allows MSPs to become experts in the domains that organisations hire them
        for. Typically, managed IT services within large organisations include: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>IT
        helpdesk support<\/li><li>Data centre hosting&nbsp;<\/li><li>Infrastructure
        management<\/li><li>Private\/hybrid cloud operations&nbsp;<\/li><li>Platforms
        and applications<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Managed IT services at any scale<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hiring
        is an investment, like any other investment you make within your organisation.
        You find a skill or resource gap within your organisation, you put a budget
        to fill in that gap and most importantly, you expect a profitable return on
        that investment.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>IT operations are no exception,
        and follow the exact same approach. When designing IT solutions, you start
        with the end result. The focus is typically an application or service that
        you want to provide whether internally or externally. As an example, an electronics
        retailer realises that moving to an e-commerce platform will give them a better
        market positioning. The strategic goal is transitioning to an online platform,
        and the efforts should be focused on achieving this transformation. They might
        hire a team of devops engineers that will directly contribute to that goal,
        but managing all the underlying dependencies is not strategic and will require
        a lot of time, effort and money. This includes building the underlying infrastructure
        and services that will provide functionality for the core application, and
        maintaining them 24&#215;7. At that point, why spend months in hiring and
        training a team for every underlying service if there is a cost efficient
        alternative that will allow a smooth and quick transition? <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div
        class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/HJ2pP83hRTX1FBpsQ5Udgxd2VuBRswEZOyDKDdWwR-KveuiuqgPgvygC9lH8HlHfJ1obnrkUFlbQB9ZnSUmiKexBzEZr5wGnDi_GAP9fBYdnry2aRhei10RdqlFOCtSiUQS2Wd5u\"
        alt=\"\" width=\"210\" height=\"241\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>A common
        misconception with managed IT services is that they are only cost efficient
        on the bigger scale. This is not true with most managed service providers,
        as the cost of the service is usually calculated based on the size of your
        workload, which allows you to start small and scale linearly. In my previous
        blog \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/manage-private-cloud-openstack-kubernetes-with-only-one-engineer\">How
        to manage a 24&#215;7 private cloud with one engineer<\/a>\u201d, it is clearly
        discussed how operating an <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/openstack\/managed\">OpenStack<\/a>
        private cloud can cost you less than hiring one full time cloud operations
        engineer. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding the right balance<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Managed
        IT services are not replacing your IT operations, and they never will. Finding
        the right balance between what to outsource and what to insource is the key
        to building efficient operations. A typical IT department will have two categories
        of activities. The first category consists of daily operational tasks and
        firefighting issues that come along the way (Quadrants I &amp; III). The second
        category contains long term planning for transformation and process improvement
        (Quadrant II). The first category is usually prioritised due to urgency, leaving
        little to no time for the second more effective category. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure
        class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/admin.insights.ubuntu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/32a0\/Screenshot-from-2021-06-28-20-44-47.png\"
        alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-103294\" width=\"463\" height=\"261\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hiring
        a managed service provider to take care of the daily operations will allow
        you to spend more time on improving your business by offloading activities
        from Quadrants I &amp; III that keep you from long term strategic planning.
        Focusing more on Quadrant II tasks will enable you to implement a continuous
        improvement strategy within your IT, while reducing the overall cost spent
        on operations. These savings can be allocated to your long term plans, R&amp;D
        or activities that will positively impact your business.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Looking

        Vanilla components is controlled by a set of variables that aim to keep similar
        elements spaced consistently. It is an elaborate system that hasn\u2019t been
        well documented, so as a first step towards full documentation, this iteration
        we completed a visual audit. We also identified and fixed a few cases of incorrect

        refactoring our code to the right convention and aligning the UI components
        with the rest of the React app. As far as the progress goes, our dashboard,

        this two week iteration, we focused on exposing the cloning API to the UI,
        where we want to allow MAAS users to clone network and\/or storage configurations
        from a source machine to multiple destination machines. We worked through
        a few explorations of interaction design to figure out how this could fit
        with the current workflow. Here is our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.figma.com\/proto\/krHkPyCmE5MttzCRTUhJIT\/%5B21.10%5D-Cloning-UI?node-id=0%3A3&amp;frame-preset-name=Desktop&amp;scaling=contain&amp;page-id=0%3A1\">first
        prototype of the new cloning UI<\/a>, if you want to try it out.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        overall flow starts at selecting destination machines. When a user selects
        multiple machines, they have an option to clone the networking and\/or the
        storage configurations from a source machine into the selected destination
        machines.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/UwzG2w0B0Fq7e43BU3FQiykXDyfl11LPvKS5e510lPAHPKwfTXAqK4ca2GhqrVTadEBBPBA7LZThqOk93cy72kmod_DUjIOwaHcHjJQ4VPhnC7O-6bgbZa7WzUbCSOteo30pHi_4\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In this workflow, we assume that our users
        would already know which source machine they want to clone from and that cloning
        will work with a homogeneous hardware environment.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure
        class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/bvJ1FoD_-3gOmEKzRoHzYJnlLdOMIqh5yn9RiImOWw47FFAoZ2bryrGqCWz8ZAZPWamJ1zm2MlVHOx3TwSp2OXYATMin58Ulba-6me_i0xwSyBapbwLtt_w5alYoU87aywOYz_k6\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can either clone the storage or network
        configuration from the source machine to the destination machine or both!
        Since our assumption is that you would already have an idea of which source
        machine you want to clone from, the search function allows you to search by
        hostname or system id. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be able to successfully clone
        machines, the source and destination machines need to be in one of the following
        states: failed testing, allocated, or ready. In addition, the user needs to
        have admin permission on all machines that the cloning will be performed on.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the source machine is selected from the
        drop-down list, you will see a brief summary of the source machine, including
        the network and storage information. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img

        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the cloning process is complete, we will
        report the number of successful machines and error machines, allowing you
        to either select other machines to clone or inform why the cloning process
        failed.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the more common mistakes is to clone
        machines with different disk sizes. In our current API, if the destination
        machine has a smaller disk size than the source machine, cloning will not
        be successful. The same mental model goes for block devices as well. Other
        errors that can occur includes, selecting machines with unmatched boot methods
        and unmatching networking interfaces.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Showing IP
        addresses in the UI network card<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We received a <a href=\"https:\/\/bugs.launchpad.net\/maas\/+bug\/1927106\">bug
        report<\/a> that the IP address should be surfaced to the network summary
        card because it is one of the most important pieces of information regarding
        the Network tab of a machine in MAAS. However, we were not showing that information
        in the network card in the Summary section.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it
        looked like the IP address was way more relevant than the MAC address, MAC
        address and DHCP were very important in an enterprise-level MAAS and cannot
        be eliminated from the Network card and we cannot disregard that, especially,
        for debugging purposes.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that in mind, we initially
        looked for a way to switch between both of them, MAC addresses and IP addresses,
        since space matters in this kind of card.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The final
        decision, nonetheless, was to show both. In addition, we took this opportunity
        to enrich the table and include more information from the Network tab, like
        subnet and VLAN.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/344doIfVH1WVzFTcXa2xhjl32QeL8CKyVfybjg_uR8Ve_eOo66zBjRrNanKFo0uuVkL0Gnsp52HwE7Mx1XcK8i0lACnA31I9i1W2zkrO-x2k4HZpBomaqugqYOBq4wqLgy7OhQBG\"

        of the Ubuntu Advantage User Interface<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this iteration,
        the UX team has been working on a full redesign of the Advantage interface
        for signed-in users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know the current UI at <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/pro\">\/pro<\/a>
        causes problems for some users and doesn\u2019t expose all the functionality
        of users\u2019 UA subscriptions in an obvious and usable way.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some
        of the issues we identified from user interviews and metrics are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It\u2019s
        hard for users to find the right token to attach machines<\/li><li>Users sometimes
        use their personal token by mistake, instead of their paid UA subscription<\/li><li>Documentation
        is spread out into multiple places<\/li><li>There\u2019s no clear route to
        get support or open a case<\/li><li>Users may have purchased subscriptions
        \u201coffline\u201d through telephone sales, but still, need to manage them
        online<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The next phase of work is a visual design where
        we\u2019ll refine the designs further and ensure the look and feel of the
        interface is consistent with the <a href=\"https:\/\/vanillaframework.io\/\">Vanilla
        Framework<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apps team develops
        <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/canonical-web-and-design\/maas-ui\">the UI<\/a>
        for the <a href=\"https:\/\/launchpad.net\/maas\">MAAS project<\/a> and the

        dashboard<\/a> for the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/juju\/juju\">Juju project<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Information
        Architecture and the new MAAS layout<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this two-week iteration,
        we ran a design sprint to quickly prototype the new MAAS layout design. In
        the previous release, we created an experiment to figure out three different
        Information Architecture possibilities and we selected the one that makes
        the most sense to test out the new MAAS layout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we
        had a very limited amount of time to work on this project, we scoped our work
        to test out three main components in the UI; the new MAAS Information Architecture,
        the action bundle, and the bottom status bar. We did a rapid prototyping style
        of user-testing with six MAAS users from different environment categories.
        While testing out this prototype, we focus on three aspects of the design;
        learnability, efficiency, and error-tolerant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img

        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The design above went through several iterations
        of redesigning during the testing phase and here are our findings.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Navigation:<\/strong>
        A few people find the concept of spaces out of place in the navigation, because
        they feel that it belongs in the Networking tab and its functionality was
        not used as frequently.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Quick-access machine listing
        column:<\/strong> Five out of six people were really excited that there is
        an ability to switch between different machines to view its details because
        we\u2019ve discovered that many users had to open up several tabs for two
        reasons; 1. They are trying to compare configurations between different machines,
        2. In a huge MAAS environment, it can take longer to load the entire list
        of machines.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Bottom status bar:<\/strong> In our earlier
        prototype, we found that we were trying to fit two purposes in one concept
        by adding both local and global statuses in this area and the white background
        colour made this bar out of sight, so a lot of information that we surfaced
        was not getting enough attention. As a result, we decided to only include
        global statuses in this area and changed the background colour to make it
        stand out.<\/li><li><strong>Action bundle: <\/strong>In the previous MAAS
        design, we realised that the `Take Action` button is too far from the interaction
        point and there are too many actions inside the dropdown, so the complexity
        score is quite high. So in this prototype, we broke down the take action button
        by the most popular action and moved it closer to the interaction point. We
        hope to make it more contextual by showing the right action for different
        machine statuses. <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Our next step after we finalise these
        three components is to focus on how we can tailor the advanced search and
        filtering functionalities to match with how people work as well as templating
        machine profiles and notification center.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img

        from last week&#8217;s planning work to migrate MAAS to React more quickly,
        we\u2019ve joined forces with other web-team members to quickly turn the Angular
        legacy pages to React.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this sprint, we did a pair programming
        style sprint, where we on-board the web-team members with MAAS architecture
        and how the API works. Then we split tasks into different components and pages
        for each pair. So far we\u2019ve made really good progress in the UI where
        the Availability Zones page is now in React.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next step
        for this migration is to summarise our work task, clean up, and refactor code
        in a few places before we ship it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Vanilla<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The

        and in the process, we recreated a few of our heading styles and components
        in Figma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the pleasant surprises at this early stage
        was the ability to exactly replicate padding and margins by turning headings
        into components. This has the potential of completely eliminating white space
        guesswork when creating mockups:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img

        the side navigation, particularly on smaller breakpoints such as tablet and
        mobile, as well as tidied up the table area. The \u201cRelease date\u201d
        has been moved into its own column where previously it was below the \u201cLatest
        release\u201d which created a double column. With every row being on a single

        to take the first character of a store name and represent it in a circular

        to identify where and which store you are looking at; especially on a tablet<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        name is Beth Collins and I\u2019m a Web Engineer in the Web squad. We work
        on maintaining Canonical\u2019s sites and also some web based projects. I
        started at Canonical in September 2020, since then it\u2019s been a steep
        learning curve (in a good way) &#8211; with some exciting projects to get
        my teeth stuck into.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually studied dentistry at university,
        and worked in the field for a couple of years before I realised it wasn\u2019t
        for me (not your usual career change &#8211; I know). But it\u2019s surprising
        how many similarities there are, problem solving is problem solving whether
        it\u2019s teeth or code!&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I\u2019m not working
        I love running, dancing to old school disco music, going to festivals, going
        climbing and the occasional cold water wild swim (dip). In the past 5 years
        I\u2019ve travelled and lived in many places all over the world, including
        Melbourne, Hanoi, India, Barcelona, but have settled and now live in a small
        town on the border of Wales called Oswestry.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img

        UI<\/a> for the <a href=\"https:\/\/launchpad.net\/maas\">MAAS project<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We
        have been preparing to have six web team developers spend two weeks helping
        with the Angular to React migration. The purpose of this will be to spread
        knowledge about the tools we use to build MAAS as well as make a dent in the
        remaining pages that need to be migrated.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we\u2019ve
        been getting ready we\u2019ve used the time to document how the MAAS web UI
        works and how to get set up to work on it. Many of these notes will make their
        way into the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/canonical-web-and-design\/maas-ui\/blob\/master\/HACKING.md\">public
        maas-ui<\/a> docs.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has also been a chance to clean
        up many areas of code that might not be easy to work with for new developers.
        This has included improving our <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/canonical-web-and-design\/maas-ui\/pull\/2710\">API<\/a>
        <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/canonical-web-and-design\/maas-ui\/pull\/2682\">TypeScript<\/a>
        <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/canonical-web-and-design\/maas-ui\/pull\/2694\">types<\/a>,
        making our <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/canonical-web-and-design\/maas-ui\/pull\/2741\">form
        components<\/a> easier to use and many other small fixes.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It
        feels great to have done some spring cleaning, to have removed some tech debt
        and to have made the codebase more robust by improving our type usage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>JAAS<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The

        the dashboard this iteration, along with various bug fixes, the big feature
        we landed was adding the ability to share models so users can \u201cgrant\u201d
        or \u201crevoke\u201d access to models for other users as well as adding the

        this blog post, I\u2019ll do a deep dive into the process of designing a small
        feature on ubuntu.com &#8211; from the original need, right through the design
        phase until it\u2019s handed over to engineering. It intends to give you a
        good high-level overview of how we do user experience (UX) design at Canonical
        on a small feature like this.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Background<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our
        customers can pay for their <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/pro\">Ubuntu
        Advantage<\/a> subscriptions annually or monthly, but right now they only
        receive an invoice over email. This is fine for an MVP but not a very complete
        user experience.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to allow customers to see
        a list of their invoices, download them, and manage their payment methods.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This
        is just one small item on a busy roadmap, so we need to be efficient and produce
        a great solution in just a couple of weeks.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>User
        Research<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to our <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSfA3VCm9BzcSQEuoS3Q1KBFR4acVCC-fBD9X0D3y7FHxn0jZg\/viewform\">User
        Interview Group<\/a> we have a thriving community of 100s of customers who
        are ready and willing to take part in user interviews (you can <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSfA3VCm9BzcSQEuoS3Q1KBFR4acVCC-fBD9X0D3y7FHxn0jZg\/viewform\">join
        the group<\/a> if you\u2019re interested).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We conducted
        user interviews with a diverse group of Ubuntu users, including;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A
        sysadmin at a major university<\/li><li>A board-level IT director responsible
        for support<\/li><li>A co-founder of a specialised technology company<\/li><li>A
        less-experienced IT professional running a multi-client agency<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>From
        this we were able to learn a great deal about the various reasons for buying
        Ubuntu Advantage, and how our customers like to purchase and consume the service.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some
        of our key takeaways from this research are;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>\u201cI
        pay on my own card for a few machines, and I need to get an invoice so that
        I can pass it to Finance.\u201d<\/li><li>\u201cWe support a lot of machines,
        so I\u2019d rather be invoiced for a year of support at a time instead of
        month by month.\u201d<\/li><li>\u201cSometimes I do forget to file the invoices,
        and searching my mail for them is a pain.\u201d<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>All
        really useful insight that we can build into our design &#8211; and validate
        design decisions we\u2019re making.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>User stories
        and features<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on our research, best practices and our
        product knowledge, we can construct a simple list of user stories in the format:&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs
        a [type of user] I want to [do something] so that I can [achieve a goal or
        complete a task]\u201d.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an example, based on our
        research, we knew that users wanted easy, direct access to invoices &#8211;
        so we should add a story for this.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a long-standing
        UX method that helps designers get a complete picture of the users\u2019 needs
        for a feature. We might not capture everything in this first version, but
        we should be sure that we\u2019ve met the needs expressed in our research
        phase, as well as any business needs that we\u2019re aware of.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        a basic set of user stories for this feature.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then
        specify and map these use cases onto required features. This is a good technique
        to ensure we haven\u2019t missed anything; an unmet user need on the left-hand
        side or a feature that\u2019s not really needed on the right-hand side.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again
        in our example, we could offer users a direct, one-click download of a PDF
        of each invoice to fulfil the user story.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img
        src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/tS-x5posAZUTL0yjH4TAF96jYpnOAqpJ-IRQ1UDgsWVA8bO_nbUG8stzcnrDJFdD1fPr3HSgDM7YjRNHz5_IXVFfVj-Ev7kNFlXGxprQXWUPOUvl0A1_RItGJeSluSxNf6UISjn4\"
        alt=\"Mapping user stories onto features\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Above:
        mapping user stories onto features.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>API liaison<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By
        this point, we have some clear ideas of the features we need to present to
        our users.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The front end (the UI you see in the browser)
        relies on the back end to provide its data, which comes through an API. We
        can only offer the customer an experience that can be delivered through our
        supported API, so now\u2019s the time to talk to our engineering team and
        check that what we have in mind is possible. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case,
        our API supported getting the individual dollar value of an invoice when the
        list of users invoices was requested, the dollar amount wasn\u2019t included.
        This would mean the frontend having to iterate through the invoices, which
        is slow and resource-intensive.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, our backend team
        took an issue to enrich the API response with the dollar amount of each invoice
        in the list.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we had skipped this step, we\u2019d
        have ended up with a much poorer user experience or created some last-minute
        work for engineering &#8211; both of which are undesirable outcomes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experience
        design and engineering aim to work closely with each other to deliver the
        best possible outcomes for our customers.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wireframes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wireframes
        are very rough page designs that intend to show how the views of the app will
        look &#8211; without the distraction of making them look nice!&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wireframes
        are quick to make and let visual designers and engineers understand the UX
        design intentions for a feature.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the examples
        below, we\u2019re showing both an \u201carchetype\u201d &#8211; how we\u2019d
        like the view to look eventually, and an \u201cMVP\u201d &#8211; a Minimum
        Viable Product which we feel is the bare minimum functionality we can release
        and it still be of use to our customers.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach
        lets our team understand not only the design for this iteration but where
        we\u2019re headed in the future &#8211; so they can make better decisions
        about their work.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img

        web team at Canonical run two-week iterations building and maintaining all
        of Canonical websites and product web interfaces. This iteration we took a
        week to go through the roadmap items and plan them across the next six months.
        Here are some of the highlights from the remaining week from this iteration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Meet
        the team<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Martin Storey. I\u2019m starting a new
        role, (and a new team), as User Research Director \u2014 which is strangely
        full circle, since I did a very brief stint of UX research on Lucid Lynx 10.04
        \u2013 \u2018Linux for human beings\u2019.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I joined Canonical\u2019s
        web and design team in 2016 as a UX Designer on JAAS, and then MAAS. I was
        Design Director from 2019.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before Canonical I worked both
        as a designer and researcher at agencies, and in-house in healthcare, government
        and fintec. My favourite design tool is the sharpie, and my favourite research
        question is \u201cTell me more about that.\u201c<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like
        old cameras, climbing mountains, making cocktails, and playing piano. I live
        in London.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/ZDf2S9GadL-j3jcnP5VvJOPpTrEDebGp-GTJBq_g6xaSsn1nRPavCVsRxUJ555WhZEBzvKM2l0FMyWty6BZBXoDcjFeVA0VAxh8E_DcatR1P4Gs5COVAiUe0tBi_Qr4xkCyPX_sz\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Web squad<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Web Squad develops
        and maintains most of <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/search?q=topic%3Awebsite+org%3Acanonical-web-and-design&amp;type=Repositories\">Canonical\u2019s
        sites<\/a> like <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/\">ubuntu.com<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/canonical.com\/\">canonical.com<\/a>
        and more.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this iteration the Web squad rebuilt
        the <a href=\"https:\/\/anbox-cloud.io\/\">Anbox Cloud<\/a> landing page,
        as part of a restructure of the site with some new pages on the way. It includes
        a video on how to build, deploy and manage your Android Cloud with Anbox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        our design strategy and create the look and feel for the company across many
        touch-points, from web, documents, exhibitions, logos and video.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Marketing
        support<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There were a number of documents and diagrams created
        in this iteration for the Marketing team to use and distribute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Brand Hierarchy<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We continued
        with our ongoing brand hierarchy work, looking at the relationship between
        Canonical and Ubuntu and how they are represented on the web. We also began
        looking at the product logos and defining a system for how they work visually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>MAAS<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        MAAS squad develops <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/canonical-web-and-design\/maas-ui\">the
        UI<\/a> for the <a href=\"https:\/\/launchpad.net\/maas\">MAAS project<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>QA
        and bug fixes for MAAS 3.0.0 release<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve been working
        on the last-minute fixes and improvements for the MAAS 3.0.0 release. We prepare
        for releases by doing a lot of QA ourselves, but we also use <a href=\"https:\/\/sentry.io\/welcome\/\">Sentry<\/a>
        to find issues in production.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img
        src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/kjNlaNV-qOL8F79bhbpIXagsWFnf4HlToaXjFMFZUefhUPZguz98ZvfAR9FP3eUCdjonJo5Vnd1nXIGoh90LoCGPfM4oIgTU9xIqdGqYzA4naszDKqkYOArvgPSR055SCYuQeRSO\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the unique challenges in MAAS is that,
        unlike a website where you only ever have one version available, in MAAS we
        get bug reports for every version of MAAS that a user might be running and
        they only stop when a user upgrades their MAAS<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In MAAS 2.9
        we made use of Sentry\u2019s tag feature to add a tag for the MAAS version.
        This meant we could more easily see the bugs that weren\u2019t fixed in 2.9
        and enabled us to make a number of those fixes for 3.0.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Vanilla<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        Vanilla squad designs and maintains the design system and <a href=\"https:\/\/vanillaframework.io\">Vanilla
        framework library<\/a>. They ensure a consistent style throughout web assets.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vanilla
        21.10 preparations<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the upcoming 21.10 cycle we want to
        help the entire team to be involved in the process of pushing Vanilla to be
        our design system. One part of that is the preparation of presentations that
        introduce various Vanilla-related topics. We listed the subjects we want to
        cover and started preparations for the first presentations<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We
        also prepared and sent a survey across our team to get a better understanding
        of how people feel about the current state of Vanilla, using it and contributing
        to it. We hope that the feedback we gather will help us improve some aspects
        of Vanilla that our team members mostly care about.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        the UK, but currently living in Barcelona. I am working on the web team as
        a front-end engineer and am hoping one day to be able to work on both front-end
        and back-end.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s only been a week but everyone has
        been really amazing, happy to answer all my questions and help me out in any
        way. I already feel right at home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond programming I enjoy
        playing old school video games, trying to cook, playing guitar, camping and
        juggling.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Web squad<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Web Squad develops

        be tricky. Logos come in all shapes and sizes, and without proper care, it
        is easy to end up with a poorly balanced layout. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem
        has two aspects:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Creating a responsive section that respects
        the layout structure of the page it is part of, which in most cases means
        being aligned to a 12 column grid; but also one that self-centers odd numbers
        of logos on a row (for example, if you had 7 logos, you wouldn\u2019t want
        6 logos on one line followed by one left-aligned logo on the second line)<\/li><li>Image
        sizing: adjusting individual logos\u2019 size and position within their bounding
        box in order to make them appear well balanced<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Until
        recently, achieving the layout aspect with Vanilla was a laborious endeavour,
        as it required a lot of classes to cover all breakpoints, and was prone to
        error unless you\u2019re proficient at using the grid. As a designer, I don\u2019t
        mind fiddling with the markup until I get it to behave the way I want, but
        I can understand why developers aren\u2019t too keen to do it. As a result,
        this approach never got traction and my implementation on the <a href=\"https:\/\/maas.io\/\">maas.io
        homepage<\/a> remains the only example in production as of this writing.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another inconvenience was the need to add

        a max-width, but makes no attempt at balancing them or respecting the overall
        grid layout of the page:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/vanillaframework.io\/docs\/patterns\/inline-images\"><em>inline

        section<\/a> that aims to remedy those issues.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It
        is simple to use, requiring minimal markup and no knowledge of the inner workings

        of taming logo sections involves a lot of judgement calls, but there are a
        few guiding principles that make it a more or less straightforward process.
        The goal is to introduce some sense of order by:&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Establishing

        What happens if you simply download a bunch of logos and resize them to the
        same height or width?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Logos resized to the same height.

        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do we go about improving this situation?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Establishing
        a common baseline<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Most logos feature a wordmark. We can take
        advantage of this and establish a common baseline:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure
        class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/TWcHbQ3AHzg4UX0E4q_EtE1RNUntuhDyUEtGzw9i9uxmm8Gc0cEvvTp0coo_PQROhKXbJx761zdvY0yVMcHxAZjk_lAfZ5JGs-1YGqMe8rdWHx5v4Z91oXbwKTMz6QYbUmNQSOO3\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With the baseline in place, we\u2019d ideally
        want to scale the wordmarks to roughly the same height. To do this, we need
        to select a goal height to resize to &#8211; in the example above this is
        illustrated by the \u201cAg\u201d letter pair.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this
        leads to a problem &#8211; depending on how tall our goal height is, some
        logos won\u2019t fit, or others will become too small. At this point it\u2019s
        an iterative process of adjusting the goal height until most logos fit comfortably
        within the bounding box.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting that the
        longest wordmark isn\u2019t always the best choice for goal height, as that
        would make other logos tiny. In my experience, it is best to find a size that
        works for the majority of the cases, and not worry about outliers too much.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Setting
        the goal height to match a very long wordmark like AstraZeneca makes other

        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Adjusting sizing to achieve comparable perceived
        \u201cweight\u201d<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With the wordmarks resized to a more or
        less coherent height, we now need to focus on shapes, surface area coverage,
        and colour values. All of these add up to the perceived \u201cweight\u201d,
        which we want to make as similar as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Surface
        area templates<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most logos roughly fit into 3 categories:
        an elongated rectangle (all of the logos above fit in this category), a circle,
        or a square. I keep these 3 shapes, resized to have precisely the same surface
        area, as a reference.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equal surface area templates on the
        right. Logos fitted to these shapes on the left:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img
        src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/BeKyNiTWpVx6tXL3VgF1DVnXQDtLl5Np6htkwr9p2RmoDLubZDco7CwI4h2Zxy7e9yu3Tnn-3Be0WmiOTivYO_1mYlFXWJ7db5AfUbs3zLgwhiVtVEqNy_J4plAsJfMFNr8ziryU\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The usefulness of this step depends a lot
        on colour values and surface area coverage. For example, the Windows and HP
        logos above have similar colour values, but the Windows logo has a slightly
        larger surface area. On the other hand, the HP logo is darker, so despite
        the smaller coverage, it actually feels heaviest among the three.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared
        to the Texas instruments logo, they both look far too large &#8211; because
        of the low surface area coverage of the last logo.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To
        compensate, we might do something like this:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img
        src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/SeDF1orGxcqhhOLRRIK85VmHwGGeSb64zMtkumgId3juoo5qTKJrHsgjcNI-xnkKAdmGnvMO42bE10e9nuRmf7jXz2Y2goP41gR6qkF5veDqW0wOybMnEWWGKnAfqfSuTYlE_WjD\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A similar comparison of two circular logos:
        The lower coverage of the DELL logos mean it needs to be bigger to appear
        well balanced with the HP logo:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img
        src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/7jweXfkm5jVVwcmhgSqZ6_fUbAlS8AUP3WPFDQwCXO81ia8-EXC5BTpB1VpmxFidYc-uNMmsOU875_UoKW4PLMi-PHqGvqsDqszKf6bTTjVYuY1nT7PH6VELQFp0hrYwIJQsgGEW\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The same technique can be used to compensate
        for darker values &#8211; below, the DELL logo is slightly larger than the
        ABC logo.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/pKzBCFO7BQhmSSF-1ZsSQXcxCDdfed9OvFDlkc0WijXVj7_Q7tDySNaO5UGtuNh3XRn2gAWAVQivSbfpKu8jJbnv12hAb5BocoBDssiYZOiS1rrlJnYcNhvGRKgMJNYAYmqr5Z8X\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But what if you have round logos only? In
        this case, having a consistent size is more important than precisely balancing
        based on coverage and colour values. Instead, we can improve the balance by
        placing the heaviest logo (the black one) in the middle, and keeping all logos
        at the same size:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/s2-pw2cuvovec_j4gO5ONhjf_7OEtw2umAbOOLlXpzSlHBqeuxvBxYUck3omjiHKahz6KoJmFxFXrk5ca5k3GeLEWdlddl36_bmetxYUQpKZGFyAULzU9LNfU_uVtuO9ksK07nIm\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Curating the order of logos<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As
        a final step, if the order of the logos is up to the designer (sometimes it
        might be dictated by the nature of the relationships with the companies behind
        these logos), we can further increase balance by introducing different rhythms
        &#8211; alternations of colors, narrow vs wide, rounded vs angular, etc. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To

        <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/canonical-web-and-design\/maas-ui\">the UI<\/a>
        for the <a href=\"https:\/\/launchpad.net\/maas\">MAAS project<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>MAAS
        as LXD tenants is in QA<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this iteration, we wrapped up our
        feature work for MAAS as LXD tenants. From now on we can manage LXD projects
        via MAAS and also create a new LXD project in the LXD server via MAAS.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure
        class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/KWiytJtxP-gbCNktaQVE_DeBM2AT4Sr4aEkqj-M4ioSCrhOfUe_x0Q7C6EDxtkxvABxRlAkKZ1nhhhE1HvYH14FIl-0RAQJ9fTxHN9W6g4UrgduSfEelRyWYhzfbMgSqGu8G2lO4\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We added some UX enhancements to the table
        by showing the project overall core usage graph instead of the project-specific
        graph. From a big picture perspective, the graph did not make sense when the
        values did not add up properly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once a user looks into these
        individual projects, they will see an overall chart that helps them visualise
        existing resources efficiently and compose machines based on the information
        right provided by this view. We also created an action bar above the table
        so it has closer proximity to the action that they are going to perform. A
        user can now see relevant information and VMs that are pinned to the core
        number from here.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img

        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We have included a piece of secondary information
        about the available unpinned cores that a user can use when they compose a
        new VM. This reduces the cognitive load for our users when allocating resources
        to the VM when composing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>MAAS information architecture<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One
        of the larger goals for this cycle was to revamp our information architecture.
        This is because we want to scale future features that we envisioned and make
        sure that the current architecture is suitable for scaling. We\u2019ve discovered
        from our past usability research that many testers make the same mistake by
        clicking on the wrong tabs multiple times, which causes disengagement in the
        platform.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week we discovered a few leads from
        our \u201cCloud-like\u201d survey. This week we\u2019ve added some of the
        user stories from that survey to create two experiments that will help us
        define which category they fit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the experiment, we created
        an open card sorting study and sent it across the team in order for them to
        group these topics into a category that makes sense. We were fortunate enough
        to have 2 community contributors from discourse to help us with the card sorting
        experiment.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we received the results from participants,
        we define the weight or the similarity matrix between these topics using a
        <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/K-means_clustering\">K-means clustering<\/a>
        technique. Below is the similarity matrix from our card sorting results. The
        first experiment is about creating machines, KVM, bulk actions, deployment
        and templating. The second experiment is about setting up a MAAS environment
        (normal or High Availability), setting up the network and routing tables,
        as well as setting up controllers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img
        src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/n9041xCx5PSqC2k5IAVBXVboejxoUdMAS_zdxCw-3eXDmvbaWu86QMMCHwsL6Cuqz8StYQLna6C6MDADObp_Ei3hZzwTOxNUMyqC0zrXy3EDSKZLbZEGKM85VZDVJpj7G278d278\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From the results in this matrix, we devised
        three possible enhancements for our information architecture. We are still
        exploring these with the team to redefine MAAS in a way that can scale the
        information architecture to fit our future vision and feature enhancements.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Maintenance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As
        we draw closer to the next MAAS release we\u2019ve been fixing bugs and doing
        some much needed cleaning up.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have completed the migration
        of our React code to use a <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/erikras\/ducks-modular-redux\">Ducks<\/a>
        or <a href=\"https:\/\/redux-toolkit.js.org\/usage\/usage-guide#creating-slices-of-state\">Slice<\/a>
        based structure and we\u2019ve removed a lot of legacy code for displaying
        machine details that are now handled by our React client. These changes resulted
        in a small milestone, we now have more TypeScript than JavaScript powering
        the MAAS UI<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not the most exciting news to most, but taking
        the time to do this tidying up means it is easier to add features and maintain
        the features we have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>JAAS<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The JAAS squad
        develops the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/canonical-web-and-design\/jaas-dashboard\/\">JAAS
        dashboard<\/a> for the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/juju\/juju\">Juju project<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Improvements
        to the dashboard for Kubernetes environments<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A key mission
        for the JAAS dashboard is to provide a high-quality experience for Kubernetes
        environments. In this iteration, we have focused on improving the dashboard
        on Kubernetes models<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We added cloud logos across the dashboard
        to easily distinguish which provider type each model has. Also, there were
        a number of small data improvements to align the tables data with the data
        returned via the CLI.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img
        src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/f_4616QIYPzvxZmMkpjyCbBAZL6-EN0ZiRxa1e_tSJjQLTOTrVE3hAC6mEw6TxCR77gUFrNzQx5VqgCr0CrbFFSfwACkmjMz_0uJwXaM7HwhhXZ00vslEpERrdlwsgavg-r-uqDA\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The main change is that we have removed the
        machines view from the dashboard when viewing a Kubernetes model. This improves
        the experience for Kubernetes user by reducing the views that do not apply
        to the environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Sharing model UI<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve
        been focusing on the designs and experience for the sharing models feature.
        We incrementally improved this feature by allowing an admin the ability to
        invite new users to share a model, modify user access levels (read, write,
        admin) and remove users as well<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside the desktop experience,
        we also looked at the mobile experience as well as creating a quick prototype
        to demonstrate the interactions and transitions as creating and editing users
        provided instant feedback on the dashboard which would be hard to translate
        in documentation alone<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/bjWApe6v_kM7c9ub6l-gY_Ul8GtFLjv8U_iNbIrA4h9r1c0ryJi2a3lwE5SP0tqQ2gGl_6sIJwtP4vjttvHLnwG6ZPoPOrOr39ZpjDQ3PWTksZM7S3HluHUMik8mi2VDOirpIkMK\"

        framework library<\/a>. They ensure a consistent style throughout web assets.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Automating
        React components releases<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We constantly work on improving
        the integration between Vanilla CSS library and our React components. One
        important aspect of these two packages&#8217; coexistence is the consistency
        of their releases, so we worked on automating the releases for React components
        to make the process similar to the one we already implemented in Vanilla.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A
        combination of <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/release-drafter\/release-drafter\">Release
        Drafter<\/a> action to populate release notes and GitHub workflow that publishes
        <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/@canonical\/react-components\">package
        to npm<\/a> automatically with every release will allow us to reduce the amount
        of manual work every time we want to release Vanilla and React components.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Modal focus accessibility<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One
        of the outstanding issues we had after the accessibility audit was focus management
        in modal dialogs. We worked on improving our modal examples to show how the
        focus should be moved between elements when a modal dialog is opened and closed,
        and how the focus should not leave the dialog as long as it\u2019s open<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        Worldwide Internet Users<br>Data from Internet World Stats 2020 Q3 (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.internetworldstats.co\/\">www.internetworldstats.co<\/a>)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Internet
        usage statistics (Fig.1) show that at the Q3 of 2020 the 51.8% of the total
        Internet users were based in Asia; 14.8% in Europe; 12.8% in Africa, 9.5%
        in Latin America and only the 6.8% in North America.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another
        considerable data is the Internet World Penetration Rates, showing that 63.2%
        of the entire world population has access to the Internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>North
        America leads the list with the 90.3% of Internet penetration; 87.2% for Europe,
        59.5% for Asia, and 47.1% for Africa (IWS Q3 2020). This data clearly demonstrates
        that Asia and Africa have the possibility to double their Internet penetration
        rate in relation to their population, with even more important effects on
        the entire geography of Internet worldwide users compared to today\u2019s
        (already impressive) statistic. The US and EU, on the contrary, have a very
        limited growth left in their Internet penetration rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Internet
        users in Asia have grown 2,268% from 2000 to 2020 (IWS 2020); from 9% of world
        Internet usage in 2005 to 42% in 2016 (ICT Facts and Figures 2005, 2010, 2016).
        Africa had an even more dramatic growth with 12,975% of Internet users from
        2000 to 2020 (IWS 2020); from 2% of the world Internet usage in 2005 to 25%
        in 2016 (ICT Facts and Figures 2005, 2010, 2016). It is interesting to note
        that since about 2010 smartphones have hugely impacted the growth of the Internet
        world user base, especially for markets without the access to desktop\/laptop
        computers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is very important to highlight the fact that
        Asia is a very large geographic continent that includes a multitude of different
        cultures and countries such as China, Japan, Afghanistan, India, Indonesia,
        Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, Uzbekistan, Korea, and many others.
        The same is equally true for the African continent, and the diversity that
        we find in these two large continents is also represented by an inner multiculturalism
        inside and within nations: the People&#8217;s Republic of China officially
        recognised 56 ethnic groups (Journal of Southwest University for Nationalities,
        2009).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>English is the first language for the content of worldwide
        websites with 51.9%, followed by Russian with 6.7%, and Japanese with 5.6%
        (W3Techs 2018).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Internet users by language shows English first
        with 26.3%, followed by Chinese with 20.8%, and Spanish with 7.7% (IWS 2018).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Challenges
        that global companies face<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering all of this, what are
        the practical challenges? From these statistics appears clear that the concept
        of a global standard that can be applied anywhere is a shallow approach towards
        multiculturalism. This is the fast-changing and diverse worldwide audience
        that contemporary designers need to consider during the design process of
        global products and services. For the effectiveness of the design, but also
        to avoid ethnicity and gender stereotypes, designers need to integrate and
        develop cross-cultural methods. Researchers and designers should also consider
        and acknowledge that their own culture and background can affect, also unintentionally,
        the objectivity of their findings and the following overall design process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When
        ignoring the spectrum of cultural sensitivities, the design output excludes
        users and customers, resulting in a failure of the product in those markets.
        Effective localised cross-cultural products and services go beyond the translation
        of the language and will appear to the target group as products created within
        the local culture; \u201cIt is expected that when web sites are appropriate
        and culturally sensitive, then users will have increase access to content
        and enhanced user experiences\u201d (Cyr and Trevor-Smith 2004). It is therefore
        important for a successful localisation to include various elements of the
        user interface and interaction design for an engaging user experience: language,
        layout, structure, content, navigation, symbols, multimedia, colour scheme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As
        shown in the research \u201cCultural Representation for Multi-culture Interaction
        Design\u201d (Sheikh et al 2009), the challenges for an effective design solution
        for cultural inclusion do not arise only from language, currency, number,
        date, but also from those cultural differences that affect categorization
        of items, taxonomy, and concepts. The research focuses on the classification
        and content organisation, clearly demonstrating that \u201cnot only the content,
        but also the way this content is organised and classified reflects the values
        and interpretive practices of the culture in which it was produced\u201d (Sheikh
        et al 2009). The organisation of the web content is often made by a person
        of a different culture, it is then important to employ cross-cultural research
        and user testing methods.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Multidisciplinary approach towards
        multiculturalism<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is complicated to discern what culture
        is. It is a matter that has been explored and analysed from different points
        of view and subjects. A culture can be part of a specific nation, and it is
        often confused as a country, but a nation is not a synonym of a specific culture.
        Nation and national identities are in fact artificial constructions that are
        perceived to be natural, inherent as a culture. As Gimeno Mart\u00ednez (2016)
        states, design and visual communication are part of the national identities,
        and design is involved in creating the national framework made of memories,
        folk art, symbols, myth, flags, coins, emblems, and traditions (Fig.2).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        work of Geert Hofstede and Edward T. Hall<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Geert Hofstede was
        a cultural anthropologist who between 1967 and 1973 conducted a large study
        with IBM employees from 53 different countries. He collected and compared
        the answers of 117,000 employees in order to analyse patterns of cultural
        similarities and differences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his <strong>Cultural Dimensions
        framework<\/strong> theory Hofstede identified six main dimensions; based
        on the findings, each country has a score with values from the lowest 1 to
        the highest 120 for each dimension representing the cultural differences and
        tendencies.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Edward T. Hall was an anthropologist and researcher
        in cross-cultural subjects. Hall observed that fundamental miscommunications
        are caused by the diverse perceptions of people from different cultures. By
        researching the styles of people\u2019s communication, and the relations between
        them, Hall divided cultures in<strong> high-context<\/strong> and <strong>low-context<\/strong>
        groups. High-context cultures use more contextual clues (body language, gestures,
        silence) in order to communicate concepts and rules; this group includes countries
        such as Japan, Italy, France, Spain, China. Low context cultures communicate
        in a more direct and straightforward way, with more explanation, without taking
        for granted ideas and concept; this list includes Germany, USA, Scandinavia,
        Switzerland among other countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some examples of how high-context
        and low-context cultures different approach is translated on the user interface
        of modern websites:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>High-context culture websites<\/strong>
        are expected to focus more on human relations, reflecting a presence of imagery
        and non-textual communication (multimedia, animation, sound).<\/li><li><strong>Low-context
        culture websites<\/strong> are expected to propose more text as main communication,
        websites as informative and practical source.<\/li><li><strong>High-context
        cultures<\/strong> value collectivism, it is expected a communication that
        shows a group of people, in contrast with low-context culture websites with
        photos of individuals.<\/li><li><strong>Low-context culture websites<\/strong>
        expected consistency in their layout and UI elements<\/li><li><strong>high-context
        culture websites<\/strong> give more prominence to aesthetic elements.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It
        is interesting to note that even if the work of Hall and Hofstede have been
        criticised for their general approach of identifying nations and countries
        with cultures and for being outdated after decades of globalisation, their
        frameworks are still widely used today in many researches, marketing and academic
        studies.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Examples<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>McDonalds<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In
        her article (Wurtz, 2005) \u201cIntercultural Communication on Web sites:
        A Cross-Cultural Analysis of Web sites from High-Context Cultures and Low-Context
        Cultures\u201d, Elizabeth Wurtz bases her study on the cultural theories of
        Edward Hall and Geert Hofstede, featuring practical comparisons and detailed
        analysis of the differences found in the international websites of the multinational
        corporation McDonald\u2019s.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>PepsiCo<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In
        \u201cPepsi across cultures: analysis and cross-cultural comparison of Pepsi
        websites\u201d Chirkova (2011) analysed the cultural adaptations on the user
        experience of the Pepsi products\u2019 websites using the cultural dimensions
        theories by Hofstede and Hall as a framework. As a conclusion, Chirkova (2011)
        confirms that \u201cPepsiCo takes at least to some extent into consideration
        differences between cultures and tries to adopt its marketing strategies on
        the global market to local cultures\u201d, reflecting cultural traits in different
        and localised websites. Across over 200 countries, at the time (2011) the
        analysis didn\u2019t find two identical websites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conclusion
        of these studies demonstrate that the cultural patterns and mental models
        highlighted by Hofstede and Hall are valuable also when translated on the
        web, even if with some approximation, including elements such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Presence
        of images with people, their demographics, gender, age<\/li><li>Presence of
        marketing campaigns or competitions<\/li><li>Overall symmetry of the layout<\/li><li>How
        the information is represented<\/li><li>Use of multimedia, effects, animation,
        sound<\/li><li>Presence of historical information<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It
        is important to implement these multidisciplinary tools with the study of
        the target group in order to achieve a more effective cross-cultural design:
        \u201cthe validity of the results could be further enhanced through the involvement
        of participants from the countries from which the Websites originate, and
        the incorporation of users\u2019 perspectives in evaluating the appeal, usability,
        and cultural appropriateness of Website designs.\u201d (Wurtz 2005).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn
        order to succeed with different cultures, global corporates should focus on
        the localisation of a product or service that embraces cross-cultural approaches,
        researching the local culture without pursuing a global standard.\u201d Nemani
        (2011).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cross-cultural methods<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As Aaron
        Marcus (2000) states \u201cDifferent cultures look for a different data to
        make decisions\u201d, and it is confirmed in the findings of the research<em>
        Cultural Representation for Multi-culture Interaction Design<\/em> (Sheikh
        et al 2009). The study is based on how users from dissimilar cultures (British
        and Pakistani in this case) categorise and classify items differently, highlighting
        that cultural aspects are deeply rooted in users\u2019 mental model. For this
        research, Sheikh, Fields and Duncker used card sorting during the user testing
        sessions to identify and categorise food items (Fig.3).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        only the content, but also the way this content is organised and classified
        reflects the values and interpretive practices of the culture in which it
        was produced\u201d Sheikh (2009).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cultural bias in User-Centred
        Design<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>User-centred design (UCD) method relies generally on
        an initial research, where designers or researchers gather information on
        the target group, and create personas (realistic profiles representing the
        end users), use cases and scenarios from that data. UCD also relies on the
        user testing to iterate back to previous phases in order to change and tweak
        the design, integrating it with the new findings; \u201cIn the user-centred
        design process, we are focused on the thing being designed, looking for ways
        to ensure that is meets the needs of the user\u201d (B.-N.Sanders 2002).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        actual end users are involved during the research phase and in the practice
        with user testing phases with prototypes or design mockups.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure
        class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/aAX6JFZlmDudS21YFBdnARwsBTFV3B0ptAy4GY3SlHY7veKGujSCK8zJhUmkbmKTr8v2kt4i3ekKkYtIIIZRE-SMKaV_fhknGw-Yll1A4DO1EXoKdj5Ll_vXXvDGebKvZqP-vpxi\"
        alt=\"Fair selection comic\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>By describing this practice
        it might appear clear that one of the problems of adopting UCD as a method
        for cross-cultural projects is that the cultures of the designers involved
        in the process could easily play an important role in shifting the objectivity
        of the experience in relation to the culture they are designing for. Even
        with a multidisciplinary approach, the risk of a culturally biased design
        output remains high. As Meghan (2013) states \u201cDesign itself is a social
        act, defined by the social and cultural conditioning of the recipient. The
        choice of imagery, a concern of the designer, will impact on the recipient
        in different ways\u201d.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Participatory design<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From
        User-centred design, a step forward towards designing for the users, is to
        design directly with them. As B.-N.Sanders (2002) explains, this shift does
        not involve new methodology, rather a different attitude and mindset: \u201cthe
        user becomes a critical component of the process (&#8230;) People want to
        express themselves and to participate directly and proactively in the design
        development process\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From this premise, participatory
        design appears to be a strong candidate for cross-culture projects, for its
        main characteristic of involving users actively, directly into the design
        process. When designers work on a product or a service they typically do it
        for a certain group of people; the idea is therefore to include those people,
        the end users, in the process to create their product (fig.4). As mentioned
        by B.-N.Sanders (2002) \u201cUnderstanding and empathizing with the people
        who experience artifacts, interfaces, systems and spaces can best be accomplished
        by communicating with them in the places where they live, work and play while
        they live, work and play\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure

        Example of participatory design approach, from UCD methods.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><br>As
        Rodil (2014) mentions \u201cThe design originating from the same contextual
        background as the users might not seem radical to users from that context,
        but for users from other nationalities\/cultures a proposed system can pose
        too much friction to be of use\u201d. The Internet and IT are historically
        connected to Western cultures, where they were generated, and their paradigm
        is more effective and established for Western users. Designers working on
        cross-cultural projects should be ready to question all the aspects, interactions,
        and UI design elements that are established in their own culture, instead
        of seeing them as a global solution. Since this level of detachment is difficult
        to achieve, participatory design would help by introducing local users in
        the design process; allowing designers to include context around the local
        users, their culture and knowledge, in a more direct way. Ultimately, participatory
        design is a tool for a mutual exchange of expertise and knowledge through
        a direct communication: designers bring their technical ability and design
        process; local users and communities carry the knowledge of the subject of
        the product or service that is going to be designed.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiculturalism
        and diversity cannot be ignored as they are part of the global and interconnected
        landscape that interacts with all of us every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies,
        designers and stakeholders should become more sensitive and aware of the diversity
        of their users worldwide, investing in cross-cultural methodologies beyond
        a simple localisation of the language. Embracing global diversity is one of
        the keys for successful and effective products, services and communications.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bibliography<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron,

        user interview panel<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of weeks ago I had
        amassed a decent quantity of user interviews that I needed to transcribe.
        <del>Necessity<\/del> laziness being the mother of invention, I decided to
        look around for a \u201cquick and dirty\u201d solution to avoid typing out
        4 to 5 hours of audio speech.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had great results with the
        <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/transcribe\/\">AWS \u2018Transcribe\u2019
        service<\/a> and had my transcripts done in 30 minutes &#8211; so, here\u2019s
        a quick \u201chow to\u201d guide for using Amazon\u2019s Transcribe service
        to create text transcripts of your user interviews.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step
        one: prepare the audio file<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Grab the video file that you\u2019ve
        downloaded from Google Meet, (or Zoom, or your video conferencing tool of
        choice) and run it through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ffmpeg.org\/\">ffmpeg<\/a>
        to extract just the audio:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">ffmpeg
        -i infile.mp4 outfile.mp3<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t have ffmpeg,
        you can install it on MacOS with homebrew using<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">brew
        install ffmpeg<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>or, on Ubuntu:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">sudo
        snap install ffmpeg<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;or use the relevant package manager
        of choice for your OS. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step two: upload the file&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Upload
        the resulting .mp3 audio file you just created to an Amazon S3 bucket, and
        copy the \u201cS3 URI\u201d.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img
        src=\"https:\/\/admin.insights.ubuntu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/397b\/blog-transcribe-1.png\"
        alt=\"Image showing selection of S3 URI from AWS console\" class=\"wp-image-102316\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step
        three: create a new Amazon transcribe job<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https:\/\/console.aws.amazon.com\/transcribe\/home\">Transcribe
        console<\/a>, and make a new job. Give it a name and then supply the URI of
        the object on S3, and leave the rest of the settings as their defaults.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure
        class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/admin.insights.ubuntu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/69ef\/blog-transcribe-2.png\"
        alt=\"Image showing new transcribe job creation in the AWS cnsole\" class=\"wp-image-102317\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step
        four: see your transcribed audio&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The text is displayed
        on the screen ready for you to copy and paste, or you can download a json
        file complete with timestamps if you need it.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure
        class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/admin.insights.ubuntu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/f7e8\/blog-transcribe-3.png\"
        alt=\"Image showing resulting transcription output.\" class=\"wp-image-102318\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting
        the transcription is just the start, of course &#8211; we need to analyse
        the meaning behind the words, annotate, identify take-aways and share the
        outcomes with the design team and product squad &#8211; but this shortcut
        definitely made my life easier this week.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can

        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, I\u2019m Amy. I joined Canonical as Senior
        UX Designer a week before the pandemic and haven\u2019t been back to the office
        since. Despite working remotely with the webteam, it still feels like we\u2019re
        very close and I miss everyone so much.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started
        out as a Software Engineer and discovered my passion in HCI and UX with a
        huge love for dumplings. My main purpose in life is to simplify complicated
        concepts through interaction design, haptic interfaces, and natural interactions.
        I\u2019m currently working on MAAS (Metal-as-a-service) which is an awesome
        provisioning tool for private cloud infrastructure. Some of you might have
        seen my work on the CLI prototype, workload annotations, event logs handling,
        LXD projects in MAAS, and many more to come.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I &#x2764;&#xfe0f;&nbsp;
        cooking because it is very much like product designing &#8211; when you learn
        enough about your audiences\u2019 taste palette, you know how to create a
        cool dish that they will enjoy. Food, to me, is a form of art that brings
        you good friends and family. If you really want to make friends, go to someone\u2019s
        house and eat with him or her, the people who give you their food give you
        their heart.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Web squad<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Web Squad develops
        and maintains most of <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/search?q=topic%3Awebsite+org%3Acanonical-web-and-design&amp;type=Repositories\">Canonical\u2019s

        of services which require authentication with our <a href=\"https:\/\/login.ubuntu.com\">Ubuntu
        SSO<\/a>. Each service which requires login handles the login within the page
        in different ways.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We now have a login option available

        team asked if we had a tool for checking links across our websites which could
        discover broken links in Canonical\u2019s documentation and report these issues
        to them. We use a tool called <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/linkchecker\/linkchecker\">linkchecker<\/a>
        to crawl our sites and report issues to use in our internal <a href=\"https:\/\/mattermost.com\/\">Mattermost<\/a>
        channel.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, we decided to set up the same system
        to the docs team. We introduced a new set of Github actions to crawl all the
        sets of docs. And, on a weekly cadence report back any issues to the Docs
        channel.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This docs we are now scanning regularly are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a

        up the self-driven snap upgrade feature<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After six design iterations,
        we\u2019ve come to the final design for the first phase of development. In
        this work, our goal is to provide upgrade control to MAAS users with snap
        package format, where all users will be able to select their ideal upgrade
        time and walk through the upgrading process with error tolerance and security.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In
        the first phase of our delivery, we want to focus on making sure the data
        we show are clear and relevant enough to inform our users about the upgrade
        and the stages that each controller is going through.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        but a many changes regarding the data. We\u2019ve simplified the data changes
        into 5 stages from 7+ stages.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Investigate Information
        Architecture revamp<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the beginning of this cycle, we\u2019ve
        sent out a cloud-like experience survey to 100 participants to understand
        our users\u2019 MAAS environment and the scale that we should aim for. The
        problem with the current information architecture is that it is hard to scale
        and identify the right flow. So with this work, we hope to identify some overlaps
        between each feature, simplify them and categorise them properly.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure
        class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/dTV0JQh-7t4Y0W_I69ITspr_LmRrWwxWgB5CXSu02vv8yOlQTytWqWXHFOWeYAOrv1GBUhjROO3Jd9Yn5_5MpOA99rCs2gIyAoeMvCkRoQmgJHZTEpowKWyMOJDuS_PSG6b54xtZ\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With the information we received from 11 responses
        in the survey, we are able to gather some lead on which user group we should
        focus on and how these extreme user groups will provide use cases that will
        be sufficient for all other use cases in our platform. We\u2019ve also learned
        about the scale and future scaling potential that can try to target and how
        these user stories can impact the organisation of Information Architecture.
        We are still accepting feedback from anyone in the MAAS community who is interested
        in contributing to MAAS for a better experience. Here is the <a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/open?id=1Rt7hk5WQyLB5DTv3rCB-p3mLLlgtz0nTjO6fve-nvrI\">link

        and logs view to React<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This week we finished migrating the
        machine details from AngularJS to React. The new machine details has many
        bug fixes, performance improvements, UX and UI tweaks and a few new features
        as well.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of work went into this migration so we\u2019re
        all happy to have this behind us and can\u2019t wait to deliver it to our
        users in the next release.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img

        usage across multiple LXD projects. In the \u201cResources\u201d tab you can
        now view how much memory\/CPU a LXD project is using in context of the entire

        styles from React components<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This iteration we focused our

        the time this iteration to make a number of improvements to our tooltip pattern,
        from minor changes like ensuring they appear above all other visible elements
        on the page, to more significant changes involving the use of JavaScript.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our
        <a href=\"https:\/\/vanillaframework.io\/docs\/examples\/patterns\/tooltips\/default\">current,
        default tooltip pattern<\/a> is based purely in HTML and CSS, and works well
        in many situations, but has a few limitations. First, the actual tooltip needs
        to be a child of the element the tooltip should appear next to, otherwise
        we can\u2019t reliably target the tooltip through CSS alone.\u00a0<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We
        encountered a situation where it was preferable to have the tooltip element
        exist away from the parent element, so we created a new class &#8211; launching
        with the next Vanilla release &#8211; that allows a user to do that with a
        small amount of JavaScript to listen for certain trigger events.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By
        introducing JavaScript, we were also able to offer guidance on how and when
        tooltips should appear. The CSS only version has tooltips appear as soon as
        the user passes over the element, which may be distracting if the cursor was
        actually on the way to another point on the page. Because we want tooltips
        to appear when the page is being navigated by either a mouse or a keyboard,
        or both, it is also possible to make two tooltips appear at the same time.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure
        class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/tQ30alnWAs4bfBvVnwbJ0X-L4FsK_3reUHFr7NvQbS32mltF37DV7kBW7mHVuotKetowcccwuuDqg7izILx92rWYWWcgGgadlvKn0rG4CQD3pX6RryUQt_v-7I18lzt7UV6Br8uh\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a JavaScript solution allows us to wait
        a short time, 200 milliseconds, to ensure the user intends for either the
        cursor or the current focus of the page to be on the element in question,
        before showing the tooltip.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can also then ensure
        that only one tooltip is ever visible at a time, and make a tooltip disappear
        when a user has clicked the target element, an event we can be reasonably
        sure indicates that the user no longer has need of the tooltip and its information.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/canonical-web-and-design\/maas-ui\">the UI<\/a>
        for the <a href=\"https:\/\/launchpad.net\/maas\">MAAS project<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Machine
        logs<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We have been implementing some improvements to the event
        logs in MAAS. Knowing why something has gone wrong is an important part of
        managing machines. During the discovery phase, we\u2019ve learned that most
        MAAS users clicked on the wrong tab when they tried to debug MAAS. They clicked
        on the Logs tab when what they are trying to achieve is to see information
        in the Events tab. To reduce that cognitive evaluation and discontinuity,
        we want our users to achieve their goals efficiently.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So
        far we\u2019ve improved the navigation and display of event logs and the installation
        output.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also added pagination to show 25 logs by default
        and allow people to expand their log screens as they like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>LXD projects<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re continuing
        to implement the changes to LXD KVM pages. There is now a project tab for
        LXD KVMs that displays the VMs in a project and the hardware details for the
        project and the VMs inside it.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When an LXD project is added
        to MAAS or created in MAAS, it will be grouped by the LXD address that it
        belongs to. The purpose of this feature is for MAAS to not take control of
        the entire LXD server, but to manage only projects that MAAS has permission
        to. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/u-3RQWgFRF0anFpw-o_BeIVyLadtAhY4gx08H58xiG9rs8P0y0QGZSj60P2yvvLRnBA6E2ilXYsleDeQYflzWDbxhdyL0o4whsamSizDnGek8SzcTYas9mn-CyOKoFA-IOg5i3nV\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Self-driven snap upgrade<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In
        this 2 weeks iteration, MAAS is also focusing on the UX of our new feature
        &#8211; self-driven snap upgrade. When MAAS is installed via snap and a newer
        release is pushed into the snap stream, MAAS will automatically upgrade its
        version. A lot of times this is not the most ideal scenario for a production
        environment. So the main purpose of this feature is to help MAAS administrators
        take control of the upgrade process if they have a snap package format in
        their environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We created a very quick prototype of how
        this feature would work in the UI and tested it out with eight people. Three
        from the Snapd team, two from field engineering as they have a lot of user
        insights, two avid users of MAAS at Canonical and, fortunately, one MAAS community
        member. The focus values of this research are error-tolerant and security.
        We want our users to feel that they can trust the UI to upgrade MAAS and that
        the UI has ways to prevent errors from happening, while also helping them
        recover from any mistakes that they made.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, we found
        several gaps in the prototype and our assumptions, which are definitely very
        helpful for our next design iteration. We discovered that people feel secure
        when there is a presence of information and that their expectations are communicated
        properly. When people are working with the unknown, they feel hesitant to
        click on something that might break. The ability to review and approve of
        what will happen construes the value of trust.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below
        is one of the screenshots from our prototype.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        Cross Model Relations in the dashboard. This has been forked into two streams
        of work. The first part being, how are our users able to create, consume and
        relate offers in the dashboard which has gone into visual design. The second
        part is how the CMR information will be displayed on the dashboard pages,
        how they relate and interact with other parts of the information in the tables,
        the topology and other parts we need to explore. This is currently being worked
        on by UX.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following screenshots show creating an offer,

        of this iteration was the maintenance of the Vanilla framework and the docs.
        We managed to fix many small issues that included bugs, small updates, or
        improvements to the documentation and the examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Snapcraft
        and Charmhub<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Snapcraft team works closely with the Store
        team to develop and maintain the <a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\">Snap Store
        site<\/a> and the upcoming Charmhub site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Discourse header<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re
        adding the <a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/\">snapcraft.io<\/a> header to
        <a href=\"https:\/\/forum.discourse.com\">forum.discourse.com<\/a> to give
        the sites a consistent experience. As we\u2019ve done this with most of our
        other products we\u2019re in the process of trying to provide a generic solution
        for this. To ease the reuse across all the discourse instances, with variables
        to add branding colours etc. This will hopefully make it much easier to maintain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Team

        June 29, 2021<\/strong> \u2013 Despite high adoption rates of cloud native
        technologies in recent years, enterprises have yet to cross the chasm to full
        adoption, but they\u2019re quickly moving in that direction, according to
        initial results of a first-of-its kind survey released today by Canonical,
        the publishers of<a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/\"> Ubuntu<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The<a
        href=\"https:\/\/juju.is\/cloud-native-kubernetes-usage-report-2021\"> Kubernetes
        and Cloud Native Operations Report<\/a>, which is still <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/kubernetes\/kubernetes-operations-survey\">open
        for participation<\/a>, has surveyed 1,200 global IT professionals so far
        on more than 40 topics about their usage of Kubernetes, bare metal, VMs, containers,
        and serverless applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report also includes insights
        from experts at Amazon, Google, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, WeaveWorks,
        Cloudbees, and HCL Technologies, whom Canonical brought together to assess
        the results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Showing the multi-dimensional nature of today\u2019s
        cloud native technology landscape, the survey found that while 45.6 percent
        of respondents report using Kubernetes in production, only 15.7 percent use
        Kubernetes exclusively.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly 30 percent run applications
        on a mix of bare metal, VMs and Kubernetes, 15.3 percent do so mostly on VMs
        with plans to fully migrate to Kubernetes, and 13.1 percent are on VMs and
        evaluating Kubernetes for deployment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI think this clearly
        shows we&#8217;ve got a long way to go before we&#8217;ve properly modernized
        the infrastructure,\u201d James Strachan, Distinguished Engineer at Cloudbees,
        said in the report.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly 78 percent of respondents reported
        at least one hybrid or multi-cloud use case in production in their organization.
        This number is likely higher than reported when teams consider SAAS or 3rd
        party managed services &#8212; those beyond what they directly manage themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As
        adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud continues to grow, new challenges are arising,
        particularly around managing the sprawl of diverse bare metal, VM, and Kubernetes
        technologies, the survey found.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Operations are said to
        be the next big challenge, with businesses looking at automation through application
        rather than configuration management. To that end nearly 30 percent say that
        trying out <a href=\"https:\/\/juju.is\">operators<\/a> is on their to-do
        list, with a further 17 percent already experimenting with them, and 14 percent
        using them in production.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> <a class=\"p-button--small
        p-button--positive\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a

        target=\"_blank\">Read full report<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other findings include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The top users of Kubernetes and cloud native technologies
        are SRE\/DevOps engineers, followed by infrastructure architects, back-end
        developers, and full-stack developers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The most important goals in using Kubernetes and cloud native technologies
        are improved maintenance, monitoring, and automation (cited by 64.6 percent
        of users), modernizing infrastructure (46.4 percent), and faster time to market
        (26.5 percent).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asked what
        they consider the most valuable qualities of these technologies, respondents
        cited cutting-edge capabilities, developer productivity, elasticity and agility,
        global reach, open source, portability, reduced OpEx and CapEx, resource optimization,
        and simpler operations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most
        common use cases for hybrid and multi-cloud are acceleration of development
        and increased automation (20.7 percent of respondents), expanding cloud backup
        options to cut costs (13.3 percent), disaster recovery (12.6 percent), and
        clustering of mission-critical databases (5.5 percent).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the top challenges Kubernetes brings to businesses?
        According to 54.5 percent of respondents, it\u2019s lack of in-house skills.
        Next are company IT structure (37.3 percent), incompatibility with legacy
        systems (32.6 percent), difficulty training users (29.7 percent), security
        and compliance concerns (24.7 percent), and integrating cloud native applications
        together (19 percent).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelsey Hightower, a developer advocate
        at Google, said of the in-house skills concern, \u201cThey don\u2019t realize
        they already have a lot of the required skills. Kubernetes is not where these
        skills originated\u2026 (These are) new terms used for older concepts. Many
        people lack confidence, because they believe that the fundamentals have changed
        somehow.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, said Alexis Richardson, founder
        and CEO of Weaveworks, \u201cWhen people worry about the basics, i.e. security,
        costs, resources, observability and configuration, this is an indication that
        they haven&#8217;t yet crossed the chasm of full enterprise adoption.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In
        a lighter note in the report, 22.5% of respondents said making coffee is the
        one thing they would like to do with K8s and currently can\u2019t. Eleven
        percent said \u201cI can do everything I need using Kubernetes\u201d, an attitude
        Richardson humorously described as \u201cKubris.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe
        report amounts to a vivid snapshot of how cloud native technologies and the
        communities around them are growing and delivering business value and where
        there is continued room for growth,\u201d said David Booth, VP of Cloud Native
        Applications at Canonical. \u201cAs an active part of the community, we\u2019re
        excited to share these insights that leverage the enormous Ubuntu user base
        as well as our proven experience working with open-source software and solving
        enterprise complexity.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> <a class=\"p-button--small p-button--positive\"

        Canonical announcing Ubuntu support for so much new hardware, the announcement
        of Ubuntu ported to a new architecture can go unnoticed. But today, we have
        a big one. Working\u00a0 with the leading <a href=\"https:\/\/riscv.org\/\">RISC-V<\/a>
        core <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sifive.com\/\">IP designer and development board
        manufacturer, SiFive<\/a>, we are proud to announce the first Ubuntu release
        for two of the most prominent SiFive boards, <a href=\"https:\/\/discourse.ubuntu.com\/t\/risc-v-on-ubuntu\/22450\">Unmatched
        and Unleashed<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>RISC-V, a new paradigm for Open Source
        hardware<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last decade, open source and open standards
        have reshaped the world we live in. Such technologies have produced long-lasting
        results and RISC-V consortium has extended open-source to develop a standard
        open-source processor architecture.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This free and open
        Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) can enable a new era of processor innovation
        through open standard collaboration with rapid industry-wide adoption. The
        architecture can be applied to a broad range of processors, from low-end microcontrollers
        to high-end server-grade processors.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SiFive and RISC-V
        International were founded with the intention of building a collaborative
        community of software and hardware innovators, all based on<a href=\"https:\/\/riscv.org\/technical\/specifications\/\">
        the RISC-V ISA<\/a>, providing a great alternative to closed-source classical
        architectures for companies with the long-term view of developing their own
        processors. It has even become a national endeavour for countries like China,
        India, and Pakistan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Consolidating reference hardware and
        software architectures<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As RISC-V gains momentum, the emerging
        industry of vendors is creating an ecosystem of products, with a pile of early
        adopters eager to begin the application development. However, there is a need
        for top-notch development systems for developers that can then be taken seamlessly
        to production.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While RISC-V enables stable reference architectures
        and hardware, running stable software on new boards can still be challenging.
        A great effort on cross-toolchain development is required, allowing the cross-compilation
        of software. The portability of applications is of great importance to move
        code to the new processor architecture.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cornerstone
        of the necessary software is the underlying Operating System (OS), which provides
        reliability and stability to the system. This demand makes the development
        on Linux even more attractive, since Linux is the most popular OS for developers
        and hobbyists, across kernel, drivers, and distributions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Open
        source initiatives are backed up by Canonical<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>At Canonical,
        we believe that open source is the best way to accelerate innovation. This
        motivates us to enable a wide range of open source communities under the Ubuntu
        umbrella. Open source software comes with its own set of challenges. Yes,
        the code can be accessed easily, but there is a gap when it comes to commercial
        deployments. What if there is a critical vulnerability (CVE) found in OSS
        used that is imperative to fix? Who provides updates with bug fixes when there
        are millions of boards out in the field? Canonical aims to position Ubuntu
        as not just the reference OS for innovators and developers, but also as the
        vehicle to enable them to take their products to market faster by letting
        them focus on their core application, without having to worry about the stability
        of the underlying frameworks. RISC-V has a lot of potential and is becoming
        a competitive ISA in multiple markets. With this premise in mind, porting
        Ubuntu to RISC-V to become the reference OS for early adopters was a no-brainer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>SiFive
        taking the lead<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sifive.com\/\">SiFive<\/a>
        (founded by the inventors of RISC-V) is one of the largest investors in RISC-V
        solutions, delivering a portfolio of commercial RISC-V products that is the
        most widely adopted in the world.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the wide
        portfolio of processor Core IP, the SiFive ecosystem of products include the
        portfolio of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sifive.com\/boards\">HiFive boards<\/a>
        based on different flavours of RISC-V processors and peripherals.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SiFive
        <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sifive.com\/boards\/hifive-unleashed\">HiFive Unleashed<\/a>

        the joint work between Canonical and SiFive engineering teams. Canonical\u2019s
        team is engaged in an ongoing process of porting Ubuntu to HiFive boards,
        backed by the SiFive engineering team, as part of a long-term collaboration
        between the two companies.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCollaboration is at the
        heart of successful, strategic, and lasting industry adoption,\u201d shares
        Calista Redmond, CEO of RISC-V. \u201cThe RISC-V community and our industry
        benefit from the contribution and collaboration that Canonical and SiFive
        have brought to RISC-V.\u201d \u201cCongratulations on this amazing milestone
        together!\u201d<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ubuntu, backed by Canonical, provides a
        commercial-grade Linux distribution that is also free to use by innovators
        and developers. \u201cWe are delighted to bring Ubuntu to SiFive hardware.
        Having first-class Ubuntu support enables the&nbsp; RISC-V ecosystem to scale
        fearlessly to production, with the assurance that they have access to the
        same enterprise-grade support and security as on other processor architectures.\u201d
        said Mark Shuttleworth, CEO and Founder at Canonical.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canonical\u2019s
        ability to validate and certify boards with Ubuntu provides a decisive factor
        for developers enabling them to focus on application development, feeling
        confident about platform quality and stability, including both &#8211; hardware
        and the underlying OS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Promising future<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As
        RISC-V platforms mature, there are a large number of initiatives striving
        hard to position products and provide for the increasing market demand. Canonical\u2019s
        goal is to standardise the underlying OS, providing a stable, secure Linux
        distribution for top-notch boards, helping early adopters to focus on their
        applications development and business case, and providing a reliable and out-of-the-box
        experience, followed by a path to commercial support for a successful go-to-market.
        Canonical\u2019s initiatives, including the security-hardened Ubuntu Core
        operating system, snap-based containerization and an app-based mindset to
        embedded systems, promises to smoothen the path for industrial, robotics,
        and automotive deployments as the industry moves to a 5G-enabled IoT era.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ubuntu

        23rd, 2021:<\/strong> Blender has partnered with Canonical to offer enterprise-grade
        support for the Blender LTS application suite.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blender
        is the free and open-source 3D creation suite for artists and media production
        experts. Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, provides professional enterprise
        support and long term security maintenance for open-source software. Working
        together, the two organizations now offer a support path for teams and studios
        as Blender rolls out their LTS model focused on users at the enterprise level.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s
        a privilege to support Blender and the fantastic work of this remarkable community,
        its founders and leaders. Today\u2019s announcement strengthens Blender with
        full-service Canonical support and long term security maintenance, and delivers
        the level of assurance that professional Blender content creators need, in
        partnership with the Blender Foundation\u201d said Mark Shuttleworth, CEO
        of Canonical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blender Foundation\u2019s Chairman Ton Roosendaal
        adds that \u201cthe way Canonical structured this service with us is exemplary
        for the open-source movement. I believe it will set a new standard for how
        independent, free groups of makers who truly care for their product and users
        participate in the market and shape the future of the industry.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        support offering will include Blender LTS releases across Linux distributions,
        Microsoft Windows, and macOS. Canonical\u2019s engineers will engage directly
        with customers to provide comprehensive technical support to users by understanding,
        diagnosing and resolving issues as swiftly as possible. Canonical will manage
        the entire support process including integration with Blender\u2019s support
        infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Existing
        Canonical Ubuntu Advantage customers who contract for Blender support will

        Canonical and Google Cloud today announce Ubuntu Pro on Google Cloud, a new
        Ubuntu offering available to all Google Cloud  users. Ubuntu Pro on Google
        Cloud allows instant access to security patching covering thousands of open
        source applications for up to 10 years and critical compliance features essential
        to running workloads in regulated environments. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google Cloud
        has long partnered with Canonical to offer innovative developer solutions,
        from desktop to Kubernetes and AI\/ML. In the vein of this collaboration,
        Google Cloud and Canonical have created a more secure, hardened, and cost-effective
        devops environment: Ubuntu Pro on Google Cloud for all enterprises to accelerate
        their cloud adoption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Enterprise
        customers are increasingly adopting Google Cloud to run their core business-critical
        and customer-facing applications,\u201d said June Yang, VP and GM, Compute,
        Google Cloud. \u201cThe availability of Ubuntu Pro on Google Cloud will offer
        our enterprise customers the additional security and compliance services needed
        for their mission-critical workloads.\u201d <br><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Ubuntu
        Pro on Google Cloud is a premium version of Ubuntu focusing on enterprise
        and production use. It provides developers\/administrators with a secured
        devops environment, addressing Security, one of the fundamental pillars for
        all IT systems. It is based on standard Ubuntu components, but comes with
        a set of additional services activated out of the box, including: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Patching
        of high and critical CVEs for Ubuntu&#8217;s universe repository, which covers
        over 30,000 packages, including Node.js, MongoDB, Redis and Apache Kafka,
        to name a few. <\/li><li>A <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/about\/release-cycle\">10
        year maintenance commitment<\/a> (For 18.04 LTS onwards. The maintenance period
        for Ubuntu Pro 16.04 LTS is 8 years.)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.ubuntu.com\/Kernel\/Livepatch\">Live
        kernel patching<\/a>, which offers VM instances increased security and higher
        uptimes. <\/li><li>Officially certified components to enable operating environments
        under compliance regimes such as FedRAMP, HIPAA, PCI, GDPR, and ISO.<\/li><li>Features
        to be available in H2 2021: Certified FIPS 140-2 components; security dashboard
        for Security Command Center, Managed Apps and more.<\/li><li>All the standard
        optimizations and security updates included in Ubuntu. <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ubuntu
        Pro for Google Cloud at Work<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gojek.com\/en-id\/\">Gojek<\/a>
        has evolved from a ride-hailing company to a technology company offering a
        suite of more than 20 services across payment, e-commerce, and transportation.
        Through their applications, they\u2019re now serving millions of users across
        Southeast Asia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWe
        needed more time to comprehensively test and migrate our Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
        workloads to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, which would mean stretching beyond the standard
        maintenance timelines for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. With Ubuntu Pro on Google Cloud,
        we now can postpone this, and in moving our 16.04 workloads to Ubuntu Pro,
        we benefit from its live kernel patching and improved security coverage for
        our key open source components,\u201d said Kartik Gupta, Engineering Manager
        for CI\/CD &amp; FinOps at Gojek<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>To help customers
        get better visibility of cost and money savings, Ubuntu Pro for Google Cloud
        embeds a transparent and innovative approach to pricing. For instance, <a
        href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/compute\/disks-image-pricing#ubuntu_pro_pricing\">Ubuntu
        Pro will be 3-4.5% of your average computing cost<\/a>, meaning the more computing
        resources you consume, the smaller percentage you pay for Ubuntu Pro. Customers
        can purchase Ubuntu Pro directly through GCP Console or Google Cloud Marketplace
        for a streamlined procurement process, enabling quicker access to these commercial
        features offered by Canonical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>
        \u201cSince 2014, Canonical has been providing Ubuntu for Google Cloud customers.
        We continuously expand security coverage, great operational efficiency, and
        native compatibility with Google Cloud features,\u201d said Alex Gallagher,
        VP of Cloud GTM at Canonical. \u201cI\u2019m excited to witness the collaboration
        between Canonical and Google Cloud to make Ubuntu Pro available. Ubuntu Pro
        on Google Cloud sets a new standard for security of operating systems and
        facilitates your migration to Google Cloud.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Getting
        started<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting started with Ubuntu Pro on Google Cloud is
        simple. You can now purchase these premium images directly from Google Cloud

        improve computing performance for researchers, ease management pains for IT
        staff<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SAUDI ARABIA, June 8, 2021 &#8212; Canonical, the
        publisher of<a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/\">Ubuntu<\/a>, announced today
        that it is working with King Abdullah University of Science and Technology
        (KAUST), a postgraduate university in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia, on a major upgrade
        of its cloud computing infrastructure. The project makes it easier and more
        economical for KAUST to manage its cloud environment while ensuring the high
        levels of computing performance that researchers need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even
        by the standards of most universities, KAUST\u2019s computing requirements
        are intense. The institution is dedicated exclusively to scientific and technological
        research, with all students undertaking PhD or master\u2019s studies. Its
        network must be able to support a wide variety of workloads without downtime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since
        2015, the university had been operating a homegrown OpenStack private cloud
        in which researchers provisioned computing resources on demand. But as usage
        grew, the system became harder for the IT team to manage. Worse, it was prone
        to outages, which slowed projects and, once complete, made it harder for peer
        reviewers to access project data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf we were going to
        scale up, we knew we needed a strategy that was more manageable, more reliable,
        and made it easier to implement upgrades and new services,\u201d said Arindam
        Chakraborty, Senior Systems Specialist at KAUST. \u201cWe began exploring
        infrastructure-as-code, and we realized that the best option would be to switch
        to a trusted third-party platform with dedicated support.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>KAUST
        chose Canonical to design and implement a new, on-premises OpenStack cloud.
        Based on Canonical\u2019s<a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/openstack\"> Charmed
        OpenStack<\/a>, the new cluster is twice the size of the old system, going
        from 10 to 20 nodes. And with<a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/pro\">
        Ubuntu Advantage for Infrastructure<\/a> support, Canonical prevents or rapidly
        resolves any OpenStack issues that KAUST encounters, before they affect research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another
        benefit is that the new deployment has caused no operational disruption or
        need to learn a new system. That\u2019s because the university\u2019s legacy
        OpenStack platform was already using Canonical\u2019s open-source software,
        and Ubuntu was by far the most widely used operating system on campus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCanonical
        offered the best server\/annum cost on the market for the level of support
        we were looking for, and we are very pleased with the results,\u201d Chakraborty
        said. \u201cThe change has meant increased performance and improved uptime
        for our students and staff. And with Canonical handling implementation and
        operational issues, our IT team is free to work on other things. Problems
        are resolved more quickly, and from a manpower perspective, we\u2019re saving
        money.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside the OpenStack migration, KAUST also
        has transitioned to DevOps and containers with Canonical\u2019s<a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/kubernetes\/features\">
        Charmed Kubernetes<\/a>, a turnkey, Kubernetes-conformant platform optimised
        for multi-cloud environments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adopting Kubernetes has transformed
        the way that KAUST researchers access computing resources. Rather than self-provisioning
        virtual machines, users can simply consume services via the cloud without
        having to worry about where or how they are running. Canonical\u2019s support
        covers Kubernetes as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re delighted to be
        working with King Abdullah University of Science and Technology,\u201d said
        Nicholas Dimotakis, VP of Field Engineering, Canonical. \u201cThe university\u2019s
        experience shows that organizations don\u2019t have to struggle with their
        cloud implementations and that, by selecting the right technology partner,
        they can operate their infrastructure far more economically while enhancing
        computing performance.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About King Abdullah University

        products, and with the new OCI Ampere A1 Compute instances, we can significantly
        decrease our per Android instance cost as it can provide the needed density
        of running a huge number of Android devices per instance,\u201d said Dean

        Operator<\/a> for Mattermost seamless application upgrades and supported features
        on Linux and Windows.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p> We\u2019re excited to announce our
        partnership with Canonical to build a <a href=\"https:\/\/charmhub.io\/mattermost-charmers-mattermost\">Mattermost
        Operator<\/a>using the <a href=\"https:\/\/juju.is\/\">Juju Operator Lifecycle
        Manager (OLM),<\/a> making it easy to install, integrate and upgrade Mattermost.
        <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mattermost Operator is part of Canonical\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/charmhub.io\/\">Open
        Operator Collection<\/a>, the largest collection of application operators,
        and can be deployed on Windows and Linux across Kubernetes and virtual estates.
        Features include PostgreSQL support on the backend, an Ubuntu SSO option for
        Mattermost Enterprise Edition E20, clustering, the storage of images and attachments
        in S3 and a Prometheus exporter for performance monitoring. This charmed operator
        also offers seamless Mattermost version upgrades, initiated by switching to
        an image with a newer version of Mattermost than the one currently deployed.
        <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a high trust collaboration platform for enterprises, data
        security and developer productivity are vital to our customers &#8211; across
        the full operational life cycle of our software,\u201d says Mattermost co-founder
        and CEO Ian Tien, \u201cWith the Canonical open-source operators, Mattermost
        can be installed in minutes with the assurance the implementation utilizes
        best practices &#8211; not just for deployment, but also for patching, upgrading
        and even re-architecting. In addition to full automation of day-to-day operations,
        these capabilities enable a unique combination of effortless ease of use across
        the entirety of the service life alongside a compliance-level rigor to data
        integrity and security.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to building the
        charmed operator for Mattermost, there will be an ongoing partnership with
        Canonical to enhance, maintain and provide best practices and documentation
        on how teams can leverage the Mattermost Operator. Through this continued
        partnership, we will work to further foster open communication and community
        engagement for wider collaboration on open source operators and projects <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This
        is an exciting time for the Mattermost community to partner with the Canonical
        community to build a full software lifecycle management via the Juju OLM.

        Today, Canonical released Ubuntu 21.04 with native Microsoft Active Directory
        integration, Wayland graphics by default, and a Flutter application development
        SDK. Separately, Canonical and Microsoft announced performance optimization
        and joint support for Microsoft SQL Server on Ubuntu.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNative
        Active Directory integration and certified Microsoft SQL Server on Ubuntu
        are top priorities for our enterprise customers.\u201d said Mark Shuttleworth,
        CEO of Canonical. \u201cFor developers and innovators, Ubuntu 21.04 delivers
        Wayland and Flutter for smoother graphics and clean, beautiful, design-led
        cross-platform development.\u201d<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ubuntu has established
        itself as the enterprise engineering platform of choice, from the desktop
        to public cloud and microservices, with a wide range of corporate adopters
        in the finance, automotive, tech and government sectors.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Canonical&#8217;s
        desktop solutions are cost-effective, easy to manage at scale, and simple
        to integrate with enterprise systems. For our 100,000 police officers, Ubuntu
        is user-friendly, reliable, and delivers the requisite privacy and security
        without additional third-party solutions. Ubuntu is our operating system of
        choice&#8221; said Lt-Colonel St\u00e9phane Dumond, French Gendarmerie Nationale.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Microsoft
        SQL Server on Ubuntu delivers an optimised, cost-effective database platform<\/strong><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enterprise
        performance and scalability work from this release have been backported to
        Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS, in support of Microsoft SQL Server. The database management
        system (DBMS) and its command-line interface (CLI) are now available on optimised
        Ubuntu images on Azure, providing a production-grade, highly available database
        platform with ten years of security maintenance. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canonical
        and Microsoft will provide integrated support for Ubuntu with Microsoft SQL
        Server deployed on-prem or through the Azure Marketplace, for mission-critical
        workloads.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The joint solution comes with performance enhancements,
        like Force Unit Access (FUA) on XFS filesystems for data durability. Persistent
        memory (PMEM) offers high-performance data storage without any additional
        configuration. Finally, the entire platform is highly available, backed by
        Corosync and Pacemaker, to ensure resilience.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Active
        Directory: Bridging the gap between system administrators and Linux developers<\/strong><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ubuntu
        machines can join an Active Directory (AD) domain at installation for central
        configuration. AD administrators can now manage Ubuntu workstations, which
        simplifies compliance with company policies.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ubuntu 21.04
        adds the ability to configure system settings from an AD domain controller.
        Using a Group Policy Client, system administrators can specify security policies
        on all connected clients, such as password policies and user access control,
        and Desktop environment settings, such as login screen, background and favourite
        apps.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Flutter and Wayland: a smoother graphics
        experience<\/strong><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ubuntu 21.04 uses Wayland by default,
        a significant leap forward in security. Firefox, OBS Studio and many applications
        built with Electron and Flutter take advantage of Wayland automatically, for
        smoother graphics and better fractional scaling.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flutter
        SDK snap build integration makes it easy to publish your multi-platform Flutter
        app for one-click install by millions of Linux desktop users.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCanonical
        has been a fantastic contributor to Flutter, enabling Linux desktop support
        in Flutter and opening up the opportunity to bring high-quality Flutter apps
        to Linux. We look forward to our continued partnership in making Flutter the
        best choice for app developers, no matter which platform they target,&#8221;
        shared Chris Sells, Product Manager, Flutter. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>New
        dark theme provides a refreshed user experience<\/strong><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>21.04
        includes a redesigned dark theme, Yaru, with accessibility improvements in
        navigation, and new file icons. Yaru is maintained by the community, backed
        by Canonical.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/O2LmMKBNNiBhLGjEvGLySkJA-cO_ZqiS8uVTDGK1fCCfhhfOMkDrUDhpeE9l6WQfEDwpTgbSxe2fH5LpbaDhBvIW-jn1DLkixH2E8kWb_lLsLOAVB1DWNEI4-yFoTZctB6I7QY5R\"

        defective livepatch for kernel 4.4 in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) was not caught
        in internal testing processes because the defect was a race condition, triggered
        by workload-specific behaviour, under load.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The livepatch
        would cause the madvise system call to block indefinitely, and thus cause
        lockup to the processes using the call. These conditions were not replicated
        in our test environment.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After passing internal testing,
        the livepatch was published to our free tier users (typically personal systems).
        Canonical services also run in this tier as an early warning system, and the
        defect was noticed at that stage. Customers with systems configured for this
        tier were also impacted. The livepatch causing the defect was retracted one
        and a half hours after publication, however the standard update process is
        designed to patch all online systems within one hour.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        faulty livepatch was addressing a Medium severity CVE (CVE-2020-29372). This
        CVE fix came in as part of our normal SRU processes. The livepatch was tested
        in combination with an embargoed high severity CVE, and at no time did we
        see any issues with systems as we tested the combined livepatch. As part of
        the analysis of the lockup we have found that systems that are running under
        load may obtain a lock that is not handled correctly after the livepatch is
        applied. If the lock was obtained after the livepatch was applied then all
        is fine. Linux kernel livepatching is a complex process that we stabilize
        through our testing, and our tier deployment process.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In
        addition to our internal testing processes, we follow a tiered deployment
        policy that releases livepatches to our customers, to reduce the risks associated
        with kernel livepatching. Customers should only receive a livepatch after
        all the internal embargoed test systems and the free tier, successfully apply
        it.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Root cause analysis<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The faulty livepatch
        was addressing a Medium severity CVE (CVE-2020-29372) and progressed through
        the following tiers of our process, (a) testing, (b) internal deployment [tier
        name: proposed], and (c) free subscription deployment [tier name: updates],
        where the problem with the patch was identified. The livepatch was removed
        and never reached the customers\u2019 tier [tier name: stable].<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        problem of the livepatch failure was that it would fail under certain race
        conditions that appear during load, causing the madvise system call, that
        was patched, to block indefinitely. In turn that caused lockup to the processes
        using the call. We have found that systems that are running under load may
        obtain a lock that is not handled correctly after the livepatch is applied.
        If the lock was obtained after the livepatch was applied then no issue was
        observed. The systems that the livepatch manifested the misbehavior were not
        in a quiescent state when the livepatch was applied.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        offending livepatch passed our testing, because of the following reasons:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Our
        testing is done on newly provisioned systems, and the conditions of reaching
        the lockup required a running system that had processes with the offending
        lock on a different state.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The internal deployment testing
        of the livepatch at the \u2018proposed\u2019 tier has failed because there
        is no workload that could simulate failure conditions.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        impact on the free subscription tier was high because:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>There
        is no mechanism in place to gradually deploy within a tier to reduce the impact
        of a faulty livepatch. All systems in a tier get the patch once every hour;
        given that the livepatch in question was not removed before one and a half
        hours had passed, we estimate that all the active free tier systems got the
        patch.<\/li><li>There is no automatic mechanism in place to recover from a
        livepatch that applies successfully but fails later.<\/li><li>The manual mechanisms
        (see the section \u201cHow a customer can fix the issue\u201d), were tedious,
        and required to disable livepatch service or the offending livepatch will
        be reapplied after reboot.<\/li><li>The token this customer had, was assigned
        to the free subscription tier.<\/li><li>Neither the customer, via the livepatch
        interface, nor our operations could identify that they were present on the
        free subscription tier. Our operations are prevented from mapping livepatch
        tokens to identities as part of the Personal Identification Information protection.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Addressing
        affected systems<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Via the grub2 boot menu:<ul><li>Select
        and boot your backup kernel.<\/li><li>The livepatch client will remove the
        failed patch, and pick up the most recent livepatch for your backup kernel.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If
        kernel command line can be accessed:<ul><li>Turn off the livepatch service
        from the kernel command line by adding <pre>systemd.mask=snap.canonical-livepatch.canonical-livepatchd.service<\/pre><\/li><li>Remove
        the offending livepatch by issuing: <pre>sudo rm -rf \/var\/snap\/canonical-livepatch\/common\/payload<\/pre><\/li><li>reboot<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If
        the system is running:\u00a0<ul><li>Disable livepatch<pre>snap stop --disable
        canonical-livepatch<\/pre><\/li><li>Remove the offending livepatch by issuing:
        <pre>sudo rm -rf \/var\/snap\/canonical-livepatch\/common\/payload<\/pre><\/li><li>Reboot<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Improvements
        on the Canonical livepatch system<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The recommendations are
        listed and classified on urgency. It is our intention to implement these recommendations
        to prevent similar issues from occurring.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Immediate<ul><li>Restrict
        the CVEs addressed by livepatch to critical and high severity; do not include
        medium CVEs via this system to balance between risk of a faulty patch, and
        impact on operations.<\/li><li>Enhance the internal testing tier [tier: proposed]
        with production or production replicating systems within Canonical or introduce
        a new tier in between. Include the status of these systems after the patch
        application in the tier qualification process to allow the patch to the next
        tier.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Short term<ul><li>Enhance our livepatch testing
        phase to include long-running systems, and not rely only on newly provisioned
        ones.<\/li><li>Make the removal of potential faulty patches, an easy process
        to perform in multiple systems and remember. Document it publicly. It is a
        process that is performed during a high stress period and must be simple for
        our customers to succeed.<\/li><li>Improve the single tier deployment strategy
        for free subscriptions and customers tiers, to include<ul><li>Not providing
        the patches to all systems at the same time, to prevent the whole tier from
        applying a potentially faulty patch within an hour. Roll the patches to different
        systems with enough delay to protect very large groups of users from getting
        a potential faulty patch at the same time.<\/li><li>In addition to the above,
        enhance the capabilities of the livepatch client application to not only prevent
        the application of known \u201cfaulty livepatches\u201d but allow setting
        up various factors for deployment such as working hours, to prevent late night
        calls to IT systems.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Long term<ul><li>Automate
        the faulty patch detection, alerting, and blacklisting. As this will be a
        heuristic detection, report and use data from the central service to make
        this reliable.<\/li><li>Automatic detection and notification of customers
        with subscriptions that are incorrectly enrolled into the free subscription
        tier.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Description

        2021<\/strong> &#8211; Canonical, Collabora and Nextcloud announce the immediate
        availability of a content collaboration platform for 64bit ARM for both consumers
        and enterprises. Building on the prior Nextcloud Ubuntu Appliance it adds
        with Collabora Online, the first viable self-hosted web office solution on
        the popular Raspberry Pi 4 platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Raspberry Pi series
        has transformed tech, bringing down the cost of anything from IoT devices
        to small home servers. Ubuntu has been leading the space offering easy to
        install and zero-management snap software packages, lowering barrier to entry
        further. Interest in Nextcloud on the Raspberry Pi has been evident from hundreds
        of online tutorials appearing over the years, as well as enthusiasm around
        an earlier collaboration between Canonical, Nextcloud and Western Digital
        on a solution for the platform. With the introduction of the Ubuntu Nextcloud
        Appliance, easy deployment of the Nextcloud Hub became available for x86 devices
        like Intel NUC&#8217;s as well as ARM devices like the Raspberry Pi, but the
        latter lacked support for a viable online office document editor. Today, the
        lack of a viable office solution is resolved with the availability of the
        widely used, open source, web office document editor Collabora Online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This
        enables tens of thousands of Raspberry Pi users to turn their Pi 4 into a
        self-hosted content collaboration and document editing solution in minutes.
        With the growing availability of 64bit ARM devices in the enterprise server
        space, larger organizations are also set to benefit from the availability
        of this platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>Installation for Installation

        the world of IoT, it is crucial to be fully in control of your devices. Over-the-air
        (OTA) updates are essential for a distributed set of devices. This must be
        carefully managed to ensure that an update is not pushed at a time where the
        device is active and operation should not be interrupted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To
        enable this level of control, we have developed the Snap Store Proxy, an on-premise
        edge proxy to the general Snap Store that can do more than simply managing
        updates. To demonstrate some of these features, we are hosting a webinar to
        introduce you to the Snap Store Proxy. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When<\/strong>:
        June 30, 2021 | 16:00 UTC<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join myself (Holly Hall, Product
        Lead at Canonical) and Przemys\u0142aw Suliga (Software Engineer at Canonical)
        to gain an understanding of the features and applications of the Snap Store
        Proxy, with a technical demonstration of how to set up, configure and use
        the proxy to control updates. We\u2019ll start with the basics, learning about
        snaps and the Snap Store, and review some potential use cases of the proxy.
        Feel free to follow along and have a working Snap Store Proxy by the end of
        the session!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> <a class=\"p-button--small p-button--positive\"

        issues of our Wayland and Xwayland support and we have made several improvements
        to our \u201cMir on X\u201d platform. Here are the more significant enhancements:&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>GBM-KMS
        back-end now has a new driver-quirks option.&nbsp;<\/li><li>&#8211;enable-key-repeat
        is now respected with Mir&#8217;s Wayland code<\/li><li>Timestamps for frame
        done events are handled under Wayland.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Adding the hostname
        to the window title when remoting via X-forwarding, improving the user experience.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Ported
        to XCB the X11 platform code and now supports resizing Mir-on-X11 windows.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally,
        Mir 2.4 supports precise floating-point pointer-events with the Wayland platform
        for high precision input events.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For further information
        please visit <a href=\"https:\/\/discourse.ubuntu.com\/t\/release-2-4-0\/22663\">the

        that Ubuntu 21.04 includes <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/tutorials\/gpio-on-raspberry-pi#1-overview\">support
        for the GPIO pins<\/a> on the Raspberry Pi. This has been a long time coming.
        We know. With support for the <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/raspberry-pi-and-ubuntu-2020-roundup\">camera
        modules and Bluetooth added last year<\/a> GPIO was the obvious next step.
        But with our Raspberry Pi focused engineers working to make sure there was
        Pi support for the <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/core\">Ubuntu Core 20 launch<\/a>
        earlier this year, GPIO got pushed back. But not longer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What\u2019s
        changed?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As of the Linux Kernel 5.11, the old methods of communicating
        with the header pins on the Raspberry Pi no longer work. Even in Raspberry
        Pi OS. This means that <a href=\"https:\/\/waldorf.waveform.org.uk\/2021\/the-pins-they-are-a-changin.html\">packages
        such as RPi.GPIO no longer function properly with the newer kernels<\/a>.
        Fortunately, there is a new package in Ubuntu 21.04 called LGPIO that allows
        full control over the header pins with the latest kernel version.\u00a0<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now
        you might be thinking, \u2018Wait, Ubuntu 21.04 released last month, why is
        this blog post so late?\u2019 Well, it\u2019s because we opened the doors
        to community members first, and I wanted to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R3YJ0brUmb0\">organise
        a community stream<\/a> over on <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntuonair.com\">UbuntuOnAir<\/a>!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What
        next?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We published <a href=\"https:\/\/discourse.ubuntu.com\/t\/how-to-use-gpio-pins-with-ubuntu-on-raspberry-pi\/22009\">a
        tutorial on Ubuntu dot com<\/a> where users can follow along and test the
        GPIO pins for themselves and let us know what they think. The tutorial covers
        some basic functionality of LGPIO, including examples using basic GPIO control,
        I\u00b2C, PWM, and SPI. I wrote a brief<a href=\"https:\/\/www.raspberrypi.org\/forums\/viewtopic.php?f=131&amp;t=310494&amp;p=1857016#p1857024\">
        note in the Raspberry Pi forum <\/a>Ubuntu sub-category to see if there was
        interest over there too, and, as a part of our (the Ubuntu Community team\u2019s)
        initiative to <a href=\"https:\/\/musing-press.com\/ubuntuonair\/\">restart
        UbuntuOnAir<\/a> we\u2019ve scheduled a live stream.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<iframe
        width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/R3YJ0brUmb0\"
        title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay;
        clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>This
        is all because we want to build a more interactive community around Ubuntu
        on the Raspberry Pi. A big part of building a community like this is starting
        conversations. That started with our call for feedback and to \u2018try things
        out&#8217;, and continues next week (June 1st) when Will Wilson (jawn-smith,
        the author of the tutorial), Dave Jones (waveform and long time Ubuntu Pi
        guy), and I sit down on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R3YJ0brUmb0\">a
        YouTube <\/a>and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/ubuntuonair\">Twitch live
        stream<\/a> to talk about Ubuntu on Raspberry Pi, the past, the future, and
        the community.\u00a0<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Set yourself a reminder and come along.
        We\u2019ll be answering all the questions and talking more about how you can
        get involved.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/admin.insights.ubuntu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/e052\/gpio.png\"

        2021<\/strong> &#8211; Canonical, Collabora and Nextcloud announce the immediate
        availability of a content collaboration platform for 64bit ARM for both consumers
        and enterprises. Building on the prior Nextcloud Ubuntu Appliance it adds
        with Collabora Online, the first viable self-hosted web office solution on
        the popular Raspberry Pi 4 platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Raspberry Pi series
        has transformed tech, bringing down the cost of anything from IoT devices
        to small home servers. Ubuntu has been leading the space offering easy to
        install and zero-management snap software packages, lowering barrier to entry
        further. Interest in Nextcloud on the Raspberry Pi has been evident from hundreds
        of online tutorials appearing over the years, as well as enthusiasm around
        an earlier collaboration between Canonical, Nextcloud and Western Digital
        on a solution for the platform. With the introduction of the Ubuntu Nextcloud
        Appliance, easy deployment of the Nextcloud Hub became available for x86 devices
        like Intel NUC&#8217;s as well as ARM devices like the Raspberry Pi, but the
        latter lacked support for a viable online office document editor. Today, the
        lack of a viable office solution is resolved with the availability of the
        widely used, open source, web office document editor Collabora Online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This
        enables tens of thousands of Raspberry Pi users to turn their Pi 4 into a
        self-hosted content collaboration and document editing solution in minutes.
        With the growing availability of 64bit ARM devices in the enterprise server
        space, larger organizations are also set to benefit from the availability
        of this platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>Installation for Installation

        order to fully benefit from Industry 4.0, the classic boundaries between operational
        technology like machine controls, the IT world and the Internet of Things
        need to be overcome. This session will explain how Bosch Rexroth approaches
        this with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ctrlx-automation.com\/\">its new complete
        automation solution ctrlX AUTOMATION<\/a> which is based on Linux with real-time
        extension, consistently open standards, app programming technology, web-based
        engineering and a comprehensive IoT connection.<br><br>Ubuntu Core enhances
        security with strict application confinement. ctrlX AUTOMATION apps run with
        all dependencies in their snaps for increased isolation. The risk of security
        vulnerabilities is minimised as the software files packaged in snaps are unalterable.
        Machine manufacturers deploying apps benefit from automated updates for security
        fixes and patches for the lifetime of the device, without the need for engineers
        to intervene. With Ubuntu Core and snaps, software updates roll back to the
        last known working version to increase uptime and reliability on the factory
        floor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/qjmj2cy4LLA\"

        is Mir?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mir is a set of libraries for creating graphical shells
        for Linux on a range of hardware. This means that there are a number of shells
        based on Mir and they work on some very different form factors. Mir is what
        glues together the \u201cshell\u201d experience, the applications and the
        hardware:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/ozR8WR4se_Cq50CxbMFfrOaNfdc5_ftLAPGcZ8sBwqJTzqsx0sUw8a_tK8o28HJntG19Z0231HPxmY48MWBbVjZasyZSfpSgotKdTxT17UYUAHrInBkiVZfNLWEsH-w89DNcD4sz\"
        alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mir works with the modern Wayland protocol
        which, in principle, provides many advantages over the traditional X protocol
        used by legacy systems. With Wayland becoming more widely supported the practice
        is now catching up with the theory.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a range of
        graphical shells created with Mir ranging from the simple \u201ckiosk\u201d
        used for IoT by the <code>mir-kiosk<\/code> snap to the Lomiri shell used
        by the Ubuntu Touch phone.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have made it simple to try
        out a range of Mir-based shells in a virtual machine. This should give you
        some idea of the possibilities of using Mir.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Creating a virtual
        machine for Mir Desktop<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re going to use Multipass
        to create a virtual machine [VM] and, as we\u2019re going to use \u201cX-forwarding\u201d
        we\u2019ll also assume that you have an ssh client and an ssh key set up on
        your computer. To install Multipass:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">snap
        install multipass<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re also going to use a utility
        script to facilitate the setup. This is shown in full here, and is available
        from github:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">git clone <a
        href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/AlanGriffiths\/multipass-utils\">https:\/\/github.com\/AlanGriffiths\/multipass-utils<\/a><br>cd
        multipass-utils<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>To create the VM:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">.\/mir-demos<br>\u2026<br>Choose
        the Mir server you''d like to try (\"0\" to exit):<br>1) egmde<br>2) miral-app<br>3)
        miral-app -kiosk<br>4) miral-app -demo-server<br>5) miral-app --window-manager
        tiling<br>6) cp --force .Xauthority snap\/mircade\/current\/&amp;&amp;mircade<br>7)
        cp --force .Xauthority snap\/egmde-confined-desktop\/current\/&amp;&amp;egmde-confined-desktop<br>#?<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We
        have created a VM called \u201cmir-demos\u201d which has been set up for running
        some Mir shells on your current desktop environment. The script can be used
        again to restart, or reconnect to the same VM. To make this faster, this is
        left running by default, but you can stop it with \u201c<code>multipass stop
        mir-demos<\/code>\u201d or delete it with \u201c<code>multipass delete --purge
        mir-demos<\/code>\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The example shells<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1)
        egmde<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/JObsQ4wDXs5q-9ReOB2RFD18lxIrAJdJboxJFmniBWKi3b0tl4hp9C4k9ojvrcYx_URvr1-V_sSMmR-4QihQyVcH_bjS-5oALwDBJIg3PpskOhP1r6_sw-B7p_xeUAvXBvCnVVBv\"
        alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Egmde is a \u201cworked example\u201d of
        building a desktop shell with Mir, there are some tutorials for developers
        interested in how it works on the <a href=\"https:\/\/discourse.ubuntu.com\/t\/egmde-a-project-that-uses-mir\/7129\">Mir
        forum<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can launch applications using <em>Ctrl-Alt-A<\/em>
        and scrolling. But, because there are not many apps installed in this \u201cbare
        bones\u201d VM, you don\u2019t get a lot of choice. However, you can use the
        terminal (<em>Ctrl-Alt-T)<\/em> to install more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Installing
        wallpaper<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To add wallpaper we need both the actual wallpaper
        and a program to show it. For this example we\u2019ll use the ubuntu-wallpapers
        package and swaybg. In the terminal in the VM type:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">sudo
        apt install swaybg ubuntu-wallpapers<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>As the egmde configuration
        doesn\u2019t (currently) allow parameters to be passed to \u201cshell components\u201d
        we need a simple script to do that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">mkdir
        bin<br>cat &gt; bin\/my-swaybg &lt;&lt;EOF<br>#!\/bin\/sh<br>exec swaybg -i
        ''\/usr\/share\/backgrounds\/warty-final-ubuntu.png''<br>EOF<br>chmod +x bin\/my-swaybg<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We
        now need to tell egmde that my-swaybg is a \u201cshell components\u201d which
        allows it to become a background.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">echo
        \"shell-components=my-swaybg\" &gt;&gt; ~\/.config\/egmde.config<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now
        close the session with <em>Ctrl-Alt-BkSp<\/em> and start it again:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure
        class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/6acg0VN7tqG5YSSUpU3hIDfZtPv5g4tmKM_3LEtZgafaBXPGZoVnq7lmakhT7kKwR7jw64VM66tO5jyxAei79rWIfPuarspNDlNL-O7mTNfKRyg2xfvjUaTyerbE3-LuMx0TrcCy\"
        alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It is possible to install other \u201cshell
        components\u201d such as Waybar and MATE-panel with a similar approach. First
        install them, then add them to <code>shell-components<\/code> in <code>~\/.config\/egmde.config<\/code>.
        They may need a little tweaking to integrate with Mir, but they basically
        work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Installing other apps<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned above,
        other applications can be installed using snap or apt from the terminal. For
        example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">sudo apt install
        neofetch<br>sudo snap install gnome-chess<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>These can be
        launched via egmde\u2019s <em>Ctrl-Alt-A<\/em> app launcher:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure
        class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/i7xjFbAee9tmiNAmyD0PJ2FXLjmUOC-v94CZzWgpGxcUqAcxK9RaBu2SwkRulibCnkfdNG6enlgNPaTp2hV1EIo9ffDTjjkqgjGBDs_p1dg-zeA5MfFVByheVhwN-6-HNFbfluEU\"
        alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>2) miral-app<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some
        other Mir shells provided in the mir-demos and mir-test-tools packages. \u201cmiral-app\u201d
        is a script to run these and the next few examples use this. These are simpler
        than the egmde example, but help show the range of possibilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        first of these \u201cmiral-app\u201d runs the default miral-shell:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure
        class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/3NIn3ITqsfbg8ObtBHn_BN3nFXdkzFR1EyEHopMH3rvPrx2CvVveWaQRyAu5ztkTLb3w-tV1v-6dHADThnuVf0JVezrjeIxADyNmdmqa7N70DMsT-vsrT6cu2aMhrmPPlRSjJAD1\"
        alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>3) miral-app -kiosk<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This
        runs the same \u201ckiosk\u201d server used in the popular mir-kiosk snap.
        The &#8220;kiosk&#8221; server would be fairly useless without a way to launch
        applications, so the script also connects a terminal to it from which you
        can run other applications. With this server everything runs fullscreen:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure
        class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/ekwoTjeu3WUrvdA4SyERFMasogTU5XPSxjzL4zWCUUrxbSFwoqiaR0ZfaA_NXWeicAaLpOTuuzpyJiIGmlzsSIh8-YDGil8iOOP080-C0fM3T2rzQ6T9BlLfNHtoUyJhslrnk289\"
        alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>4) miral-app -demo-server<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        Mir \u201cdemo server\u201d is useful for testing as it enables all the Wayland
        extensions supported by Mir. This is particularly useful if you are testing
        shell components (panels, backgrounds etc.) as all the Wayland extensions
        needed by these are enabled by default. (They can be configured for other
        shells, and egmde only enables them for \u201cshell components\u201d)<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try
        starting <code>miral-app -demo-server<\/code> and then in the terminal that
        comes up:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">sudo apt install
        swaybg ubuntu-wallpapers mate-panel<br>swaybg -i \/usr\/share\/backgrounds\/warty-final-ubuntu.png
        &amp;<br>mate-panel&amp;<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be a few error dialogs
        from Mate Panel as some widgets don\u2019t work or are not installed. If you
        select \u201cDelete\u201d they are removed from the panel and won\u2019t bother
        you again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/M5bkhErTqsrPYZHwi9VSybry-j4yARF5p6aZpNEqYY_a2gqJ1b_85_k-v1sHRqzeuhG2qPIJ9B24Q17fYpHjAwJNqYhpC4s0AfuclIPVIWh1x9tDditl04SjSij5OWhKT6UYHAjJ\"
        alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>6) cp &#8211;force .Xauthority snap\/mircade\/current\/&amp;&amp;mircade<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure
        class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/JnqSMgLT2CMs6jQeGBEvBjnxId14Gy7-Xw9kG2fgntHdGakGs5gF52Td_sir7eXC6r_I2Ku5FsIfAEsP90fEk5nxbsLkfim_coczf-yTBIu9-8grmJAY5yQf4qJZ9RBhsO83cjVM\"
        alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mircade is an example of a shell designed
        to run one fullscreen application at a time. In order to have a theme to these
        applications a few games were chosen from the archive. Obviously, you could
        do something similar with your choice of applications.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All
        the above examples have been examples of shells running in an \u201cunconfined\u201d
        environment. In contrast, these last two examples, mircade and the egmde-confined-desktop,
        work with full Snap confinement. Consequently, they can be used on the snap
        based, Ubuntu Core operating system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using Snap confinement
        means that launching this demo needs the \u201c.Xauthority\u201d file copying
        to the \u201cright place\u201d to be used by the snap. This makes these options
        look a little different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>7) cp &#8211;force .Xauthority snap\/egmde-confined-desktop\/current\/&amp;&amp;egmde-confined-desktop<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Egmde-confined-desktop,
        like mircade, is a fully confined snap. Like mircade, it can only run applications
        that are contained within the snap. (This is currently a limitation of the
        snap environment. Within this limitation, egmde-confined-desktop provides
        something close to a desktop environment, with floating windows and a more
        diverse set of example applications.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img

        for updates. The last few weeks have ushered in ROS 1 Noetic and ROS 2 Foxy,
        both of which target the recently released Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa. As always,
        new releases come with trepidation: how can I install new software and test
        compatibility, yet keep my own environment stable until I know I&#8217;m ready
        to upgrade? This is one of the many good reasons to dive into containers<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In
        this blog post we&#8217;ll create a base LXD profile with the ROS software
        repositories and full graphical capabilities enabled. Launch containers to
        meet your robotics needs: everything from software development and system
        testing through robot operations can be covered within containers.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check
        out our youtube video to see these instructions in action. Also see the full
        installation instructions for both <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"

        started<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All you need to get started is a Linux workstation
        with LXD installed. The installation of LXD is not covered here as there are
        a number of great instructions online. See the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"
        aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/linuxcontainers.org\/lxd\/getting-started-cli\/#installation\"
        target=\"_blank\">getting started guide<\/a> at <a href=\"http:\/\/linuxcontainers.org\"
        target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"linuxcontainers.org
        (opens in a new tab)\">linuxcontainers.org<\/a> for more information.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll
        cover hereafter the three basic steps to getting set up:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>
        Creating a LXD container profile<\/li><li>Launching and connecting to the
        container<\/li><li>Installing ROS<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Create a profile<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All
        LXD containers have a defined profile. A default profile was created when
        LXD was first set installed, but we will create a ROS specific profile. This
        will support running ROS (either version 1 or 2) on an Ubuntu image.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        profile contains four specific configuration features:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>ROS
        software repositories<\/li><li>Run X apps within the container<\/li><li>Networking<\/li><li>A
        disk storage device<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Gather data<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In
        order to set up the profile properly, we must first collect your workstation&#8217;s
        network adapter, and the user\/group ID for your account.&nbsp; Find your
        network adapter using the <code>ip addr show<\/code> command:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">~:$ ip addr show\n1: lo:  mtu 65536 qdisc
        noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000\n    link\/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00
        brd 00:00:00:00:00:00\n    inet 127.0.0.1\/8 scope host lo\n       valid_lft
        forever preferred_lft forever\n    inet6 ::1\/128 scope host \n       valid_lft
        forever preferred_lft forever\n2: wlp2s0:  mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN
        group default qlen 1000\n    link\/ether a8:00:0b:c0:88:e7 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n3:
        <span style=\"background-color:yellow\">enx001a98a552d4<\/span>:  mtu 1500
        qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000\n    link\/ether 00:1a:98:a5:52:d4
        brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n    inet 192.168.1.100\/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope
        global noprefixroute enx001a98a552d4\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft
        forever\n<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The above example shows three network adapters:
        loopback, wireless and ethernet (respectively). Select the adapter to use
        for the container; for this case we will use the wired adapter <code>enx001a98a552d4<\/code><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To
        find the id of your non-root account, use the <code>id<\/code> command:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">~:$ id<br>uid=1001(sid) gid=1001(sid) groups=1001(sid),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),
        ... <br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In the example above my user id &#8220;sid&#8221;
        has a uid and gid of 1001.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Create the ROS Profile<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Armed
        with these two key facts, we can create and edit the LXD profile for our ROS
        containers:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">lxc profile create
        ros<br>lxc profile edit ros<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This brings up a default
        profile template for editing within vi. Update the file as follows, then save
        and exit vi:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><code>\nconfig:\n  environment.DISPLAY:
        :0\n  raw.idmap: both <span style=\"background-color:yellow\">[your group
        id]<\/span> 1000\n  user.user-data: |\n    #cloud-config\n    runcmd:\n      -

        break down the configuration file and look at each part individually.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Configure
        the environment<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The following line sets the DISPLAY environment
        variable required by X. The display within the container is always mapped
        to &#8221;&#8217;:0&#8221;&#8217;.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">
        &nbsp;environment.DISPLAY: :0<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Our linux containers will
        run under the security context of the current user, but all work within the
        Ubuntu containers will be done under the default <code>ubuntu<\/code> user
        account. The <code>raw.imap<\/code> setting maps our workstation&#8217;s user
        and group ID (1001 in this example) into the container&#8217;s user and group
        ID (always 1000 for the default user):<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">  raw.idmap:
        both <span style=\"background-color:yellow\">1001<\/span> 1000\n<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h3>Configure
        ROS repositories<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The ROS software repositories can be added
        to the container every time a new container is launched. The simplest way
        to achieve this is to use cloud-init, and add a <code>runcmd<\/code> to the
        user-data section of the profile. Each of these commands will be executed
        whenever a new container is initialized using this profile.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        apt-key command pulls the ROS distribution signing key from github, while
        the two add-repository commands add the ROS 1 and ROS 2 software repositories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre

        devices<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding the X0 device to the profile allows X data
        to flow between the container (&#8220;path&#8221;) and the host (&#8220;source&#8221;).
        If you have multiple graphics cards check the contents of <code>\/tmp\/.X11-unix<\/code>
        to make sure you&#8217;re mapping to the correct source; the source should
        mirror the <code>$DISPLAY<\/code> environment variable from your host.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre><code>\ndevices:\n  X0:\n    path:

        disk\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a separate graphics card with
        a discrete GPU, you may also find it necessary to add the GPU as a device:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"> &nbsp;mygpu:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type:
        gpu<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name: gui<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about
        running graphical apps in LXD containers, including some caveats when working
        with an NVidia GPU, take a look at <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"

        target=\"_blank\">this blog post<\/a> by Simos Xenitellis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiple
        options exist for networking. Although a container can use LXD&#8217;s built
        in address translation or a bridge device, our profile will use the macvlan
        network driver. Macvlan creates a simple bridge between the parent network
        adapter and the container so the container receives its own IP address on
        the host network. With this setup no additional configuration (e.g., port
        forwarding) is required for either ROS 1 or ROS 2.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        network interface (nic) device configured here uses macvlan to connect the
        parent network adapter <code>enx001a98a552d4<\/code> to the container&#8217;s
        eth0 interface:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"> &nbsp;eth0:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name:
        eth0<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nictype: macvlan<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parent:
        <span style=\"background-color:yellow\">enx001a98a552d4<\/span><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type:
        nic<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.simos.info\/how-to-make-your-lxd-container-get-ip-addresses-from-your-lan\/\">this
        post<\/a> if you need more information about LXD networking with macvlan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A
        disk image must be connected to the container. This disk device simply uses
        the lxd default data pool:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">root:<br>     path:
        \/<br>     pool: default<br>     type: disk<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Launch a
        container<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>lxc launch<\/code> command is used to
        launch a container for the first time. Use the following command to create
        and run an Ubuntu 20.04 container named &#8220;ros-foxy&#8221;:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">lxc launch -p ros ubuntu:20.04 rosfoxy<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Once
        the container is running, logging in is achieved by simply executing a shell
        within the container:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">lxc
        exec rosfoxy -- bash<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This connects to a shell on the
        container under the root userid; however, our configuration uses the ubuntu
        user account. In order to connect to a shell as the ubuntu user, execute the
        su command within the container:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">lxc
        exec ros -- su --login ubuntu<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This tends to be a bit
        cumbersome to type for every connection to the container. LXD aliases provide
        an easy way to simplify the command, and also make it more generally applicable.
        Shorten the command and make it more robust by creating an LXD alias using
        this command:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">lxc alias add
        ubuntu ''exec @ARGS@ --user 1000 --group 1000 --env HOME=\/home\/ubuntu\/
        -- \/bin\/bash --login''<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about the
        options used with this alias, see <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.simos.info\/using-command-aliases-in-lxd-to-exec-a-shell\/\">this
        blog post<\/a> from Simos Xenitellis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now connecting to an
        Ubuntu container with the proper context is as simple as the following command:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">lxc ubuntu rosfoxy<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Install
        ROS<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the ROS repositories have been set up,
        installation is as simple as an apt-install command for the correct software
        bundle:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">sudo apt install
        ros-foxy-ros-desktop<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Since this container will always
        run ROS, we can source the ROS environment upon every login by adding it to
        our .bashrc startup script.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">echo
        \"source \/opt\/ros\/foxy\/setup.bash\" &gt;&gt; ~\/.bashrc<br>source ~\/.bashrc<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Most
        ROS commands support context-sensitive tab completion. Although not required,
        installing <code>python3-argcomplete<\/code> will make typing commands much
        easier:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">sudo apt install
        python3-argcomplete<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the installation is complete,
        try it out by running <code>rqt<\/code> or a similar graphical application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Using
        this ROS profile, building environments to work with different releases becomes
        trivial:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">lxc launch -p
        ros ubuntu:20.04 rosnoetic<br>lxc ubuntu rosnoetic<br>sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>LXD
        provides a number of handy commands for working with containers. For instance
        we can clone a container by simply using the lxc copy command:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">lxc copy rosfoxy rosfoxy-2<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>When
        work with the container is complete, simply remove it:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">lxc delete rosfoxy-2<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Share
        files between the host and the container, map USB devices&#8211;think robotics
        hardware&#8211;to the container with additional LXD configurations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        possibilities for containers are only limited by your imagination. For some
        ideas on how to use LXD containers for ROS development, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/ros-development-with-lxd\">this

        are being adopted more and more widely by enterprises across both hybrid and
        multi-cloud structures. However, a recent poll showed that only 10% of respondents
        had deployed containers directly at the edge. What is the reason behind this
        gap? And why companies should care about container deployment at the edge?
        Valentin Viennot, Product Manager at Canonical, presents the main obstacles
        to container adoption at the edge, and how companies can overcome them.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a

        these images come from untrustworthy sources. The thing is, a lot of images
        available on Docker Hub aren\u2019t up to standard for enterprise use. This
        is why Docker created the Docker Verified Publisher program. With over 200
        publishers, including Canonical, Docker Verified Publisher offers access to
        a trusted version of Docker Hub that provides access to secure and reliable

        was another fantastic month for robotics developments. In a continuously growing
        field, where the opportunities are many and the challenges require innovative
        solutions, researchers keep leading the way. Here at Canonical, we understand
        the value of open knowledge and collaboration. So this monthly blog brings
        some great research, available to you and me.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Climbing
        robots &#8211; the floor is getting bigger&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are
        several designs for making robots capable of climbing ceilings. However, this
        latest robot from <a href=\"https:\/\/spectrum.ieee.org\/automaton\/robotics\/robotics-hardware\/robot-sticks-to-ceilings\">Bioinspired
        Robotics and Design Lab at UCSD <\/a>managed to stick to smooth surfaces using
        a vibrating motor attached to a flexible disk.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img
        src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/zOmcipqthtkv8C6iTc4zHk3YuZ0jkJC0pa4VPsOBeXz0U45DVGflniuCLXaNgZcZ2vtyHNJC-qQSXS6F-3VhW-PwhIC-K1bXrk9Z1-_YexT-F6pD7U8Pco3IP8GlFv5XAsvOXQ-F\"
        alt=\"robot ceiling  \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to UCSD researchers,
        this is possible thanks to \u201cthe fluid mediated adhesive force between
        an oscillatory plate and a surface\u201d. See the diagram of the system below.
        The 14cm diameter flexible disk in the picture vibrates at around 200 Hz,
        creating a thin layer of low-pressure air between itself and the surface that
        it\u2019s vibrating against. Similar to the suction effect, this thin layer
        of air, which is less than 1 mm thick, allows the disk to resist 5 N of force
        pulling on it. However, the disk doesn&#8217;t need to be constantly sealed
        against a surface, which allows the robot to move freely.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure
        class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/admin.insights.ubuntu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/c01a\/robotCeilling.png\"
        alt=\"UCSD robot schematics \" class=\"wp-image-103054\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This
        vibration method can tolerate sudden loading when moving, and the disk\u2019s
        flexibility allows the robot to move on curved surfaces. The challenges start
        when sizing the robot. Going smaller means that the motor will take up a disproportionate
        amount of weight, conversely going larger means the amount of adhesion that
        you get decreases. Either way, the big advantage here is the simplicity and
        affordability of the system.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>AI designing AI<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Google\u2019s
        chip designing AI now needs less than six hours to generate chip floorplans
        with better power consumption, performance, and area than those made by people.
        Experts typically need months of iteration to do this task. An AI takes only
        a few hours.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/psPMIeoR5qi1iWKRSaf8iy8Kfz5E6el5_ymUUKW1M5Q-9ByqbjeA3iCm9XmNcZnKfgHwR6zlJxqKdPBxygWiDqJ26PIqUgrfpflD_yxRbLqtGGCeJCGhJrKxsyepI_ax5HxG7swG\"
        alt=\"Google AI chip\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>AI acceleration began aiming
        to offload CPU workload in mathematic intense operations. Today, <a href=\"https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/a-complete-guide-to-ai-accelerators-for-deep-learning-inference-gpus-aws-inferentia-and-amazon-7a5d6804ef1c\">one
        of the ways of achieving this<\/a> is with custom-designed machine learning
        inference chips. They help perform AI algorithms faster and more efficiently.
        The challenge is that it takes years to design a chip, while machine learning
        algorithms move a lot faster than that. <a href=\"https:\/\/spectrum.ieee.org\/tech-talk\/semiconductors\/design\/google-invents-ai-that-learns-a-key-part-of-chip-design\">Ideally,
        you want a chip that\u2019s optimised to do today\u2019s AI<\/a>, not the
        AI of two to five years ago. That&#8217;s why Google started developing AI
        to design AI chips.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The task is complex. Designers need
        to place blocks of logic and memory, including clusters of those blocks, in
        a way that power and performance are maximised while reducing the area of
        the chip. For those of us that have worked with PCB, we can understand the
        struggle. Even with today\u2019s advanced tools, it takes a human expert week
        of iteration to produce an acceptable design.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Google\u2019s
        researchers Goldie and Mirhoseini modelled chip placement as a reinforcement
        learning problem. Unlike typical deep learning systems, reinforcement learning
        systems learn by doing; adjusting the parameters in their networks according
        to a reward signal received when they succeed. Three parameters dictated the
        reward, a proxy measure of a combination of power reduction, performance improvement,
        and area reduction. As a result, the agent becomes better at its task the
        more designs it does.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img

        alt=\"Policy and value network architecture \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Figure
        taken from <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41586-021-03544-w\"><em>(Mirhoseini
        et al, 2021)<\/em><\/a><em> Policy and value network architecture. An embedding
        layer encodes information about the netlist adjacency, node features and the
        current macro to be placed. The policy and value networks then output a probability
        distribution over available grid cells and an estimate of the expected reward
        for the current placement, respectively.id, identification number; fc, fully
        connected layer; de-conv, deconvolution layer<\/em>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Goldie
        and Mirhoseini hope AI systems like theirs will lead to the design of \u201cmore
        chips in the same period and also chips that run faster, use less power, cost
        less to build, and use less area\u201d.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Robotics Award
        2021 goes to ABB\u00b4s PixelPaint car painting<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Innovation
        and Entrepreneurship in Robotics &amp; Automation Award (IERA) honours the
        achievements of innovators that create world-class products. The IEEE Robotics
        and Automation Society (IEEE\/RAS) and the IFR jointly sponsor the award.
        This promotes strong collaboration between science and industry in robotics.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        alt=\"ABB PixelPaint \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This year&#8217;s winner was
        ABB with their PixelPaint car. This system consists of two high-precision
        robotics arms that make car painting faster. It also increases sustainability,
        as it eliminates overspray benefiting the environment. But the added value
        is its flexibility, allowing manufacturers to efficiently respond to custom
        requests, with two-tone and customised designs applied in one pass.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applying
        a two-tone or customised design to bodywork is time and labour-intensive work.
        It requires the vehicle to be put through the painting line twice: once for
        the first layer and then after the areas had been masked, again for the second
        colour. This work requires the presence of staff, masking the bodywork. Around
        10 to 20 operators per shift are required.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With PixelPaint,
        there is no longer this challenge. Using an inkjet head to eliminate overspray,
        PixelPaint ensures that two-tone paint and individual designs are applied
        in one pass, without masking and demasking.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides, <a
        href=\"https:\/\/ifr.org\/ifr-press-releases\/news\/iera-award-2021-goes-to-abbs-pixelpaint-car-painting\">20
        to 30%t of paint is wasted due to overspray<\/a>. The inkjet head of PixelPaint
        applies 100% of the paint to the vehicle surface.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>ROS

        target=\"_blank\">Getting started with micro-ROS on the Raspberry Pi Pico&#8217;<\/a>.
        As such, I&#8217;d encourage you to read it first if you are not already familiar
        with the topic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A sensor you said?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this
        tutorial, we will make use of one of the most common sensors in robotics,
        a sonar.&nbsp; These sensors are cheap, fairly simple to use and surprisingly
        precise under favorable circumstances. Sonars are used to measure distances.
        They can therefore be used to detect and locate obstacles, so that a robot
        can avoid nearby things. It is no mystery why they are so incredibly popular.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So,
        what&#8217;s a sonar, how does it work, which one should I pick?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>&#8220;I&#8217;m
        Bat(sensor)&#8221;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A sonar is an echolocation sensor which
        allows for measuring distances. To keep things simple to digest, sonars work
        the same way as bats do. Nah they don&#8217;t fly, hunting bugs at dawn; nor
        do they fight crime. I obviously meant the same way as bats perceive the world.
        A sonar is composed of an emitter and a receiver. The former emits an ultrasound
        signal, which will bounce off of facing obstacles, back at the receiver. By
        measuring the time difference between the signal emission and reception, one
        can easily calculate the distance traveled by the sound wave, and thus, the
        distance to the obstacle that reverberated the sound.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This
        technology can suffer from all kinds of issues; if, for example, the sound
        wave is reverberated away from the sensor. Or if it is reverberated back to
        the sensor by two obstacles at different distances. Or if it is absorbed by
        some sound dampening material.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this is still unclear or
        you want to know more about it, I&#8217;ll redirect you to your favorite web
        search engine as it is a little out of the scope of this post.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Which
        sonar model to pick?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There exist plenty of different models
        of sonars, fortunately most of them work the same way. Furthermore, they can
        be found for a few bucks per unit on the internet. Head on over to your favorite
        electronics supplier and you&#8217;re sure to find them for sale.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d
        recommend you use the &#8216;HC-SR04P&#8217; model which is the 3.3V variant
        of the immensely popular &#8216;HC-SR04&#8217; (5V). It is this model (the
        &#8216;HC-SR04P&#8217;) I will be using in this post. Given its very small
        power consumption, it can be powered up directly from the Pi Pico. The whole
        setup can thus simply be powered from the USB cable. In case you are using
        a 5V package, make sure to adapt the wiring described below or else you are
        risking damages to your Pi Pico! For reference, I ordered a lot of 5 units
        for less than $10 including shipping. Including the Pi Pico price, that&#8217;s
        a lot of sensing for the price!<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wiring up the sonar to
        the Pi Pico<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8216;HC-SR04P&#8217; board comes with four
        pins labelled &#8216;Vcc&#8217;, &#8216;Gnd&#8217;, &#8216;Trig&#8217; and
        &#8216;Echo&#8217;. As you&#8217;ve already guessed, the Vcc and Gnd pins
        are for the 3.3V line and the ground respectively. &#8216;Trig&#8217; is used
        to trigger the sensor and &#8216;Echo&#8217; reports the reception of the
        echo (the reception of the wave that bounced off of an obstacle).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From
        there, and referring to the <a href=\"https:\/\/datasheets.raspberrypi.org\/pico\/Pico-R3-A4-Pinout.pdf\"
        target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new

        \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as the hardware goes, we&#8217;re done. Let
        us move to software.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Micro code for micro-ROS on Pi Pico<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve
        seen in the <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/getting-started-with-micro-ros-on-raspberry-pi-pico\"
        target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new
        tab)\">previous post<\/a> how to set up VSCode for programming micro-ros on
        the Raspberry Pi Pico, and how to compile and flash a program. We&#8217;ll
        thus jump directly for the main course, skipping all the boilerplate code
        and only show the bits specific to our application. However, know that this
        example (and more) is fully available on GitHub at <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"

        target=\"_blank\">artivis\/mico_ros<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, let&#8217;s
        dive in. Our application is essentially composed of two functions, one that
        triggers and reads the sensor, and a second, the timer callback, which calls
        the first, fill up a ROS message and publishes it:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">\/\/

        to publish range. Continuing.\\n\");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>}<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s
        pretty much it. The rest of the code is mostly boilerplate, initializing the
        GPIO, setting up the micro-ROS node, publisher, timer and executor, and having
        it all spin.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that we are using the standard &#8216;sensor_msgs\/msgs\/Range&#8217;
        message. You can find its definition and a breakdown of its field online in
        the <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.ros2.org\/latest\/api\/sensor_msgs\/msg\/Range.html\"
        target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new
        tab)\">ROS2 API documentation<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All there is to do
        now is to compile the code, flash the resulting &#8216;.uf2&#8217; file and
        start the micro-ROS agent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bip bip bip<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming
        compiling and flashing went all fine, all we have to do is to plug the board
        to our computer and launch the micro-ROS agent. To do so, we use the following
        command:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">docker run -it --rm

        topic &#8216;\/pico\/range&#8217; is advertised, that&#8217;s a good start.
        Let see what it contains,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">$

        looks great!<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could now play with your new sensor, moving
        an obstacle back and forth in front of it. Take a measuring tape and compare
        the reported distance to the measured one. You may be surprised by its accuracy,
        I know I was.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What&#8217;s next?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a
        neat little project to approach micro-ROS on the Raspberry Pi Pico and the
        possibilities it opens. It is really rewarding to see the actual distance
        between the sensor and an obstacle being readily available on the ROS 2 graph.
        By taking a step back we can start seeing a slightly larger picture; a picture
        in which one will be able to easily, effortlessly, add plug and play ROS2-ready
        hardware modules to existing robots. Plugging a camera and its feed magically
        appears on the graph. An IMU module could provide a reliable odometry source.
        A motor ready to spin in a snap (pun intended).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we
        are not there yet, I&#8217;m definitely going to follow this line of thought
        for my own Turtlebot 3. Can you believe that it doesn&#8217;t have any sonar?!<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately,
        now I can easily add a pair of them and have my robot stop bumping into my
        lazy cat lying down on the floor. Unwitting ninja, invisible to the laser
        scanner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you go tinkering with micro-ROS on your Raspberry

        of EOL<\/a> in the past, but with its final sync out on May 12th, ROS Kinetic
        is no longer supported. Together with Ubuntu Xenial, both distributions will
        no longer receive security updates or bug fixes.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ROS
        second LTS release became the largest rosdistro with 1,233 repositories over
        the last 5 years. We want to join our partner, Open Robotics, in thanking
        all of you who contributed to making ROS Kinetic a milestone in robotics history.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But
        for all of us still working with Kinetic, in our deployed robots, labs or
        universities, two questions arise: where do I migrate to and what are the
        challenges?&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To answer these questions, we asked our
        community what they think. So throughout April, we conducted 2 small polls
        on LinkedIn and Twitter. Two main questions were asked.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What
        is your ROS migration plan?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first question was straightforward,
        where are you moving? Four options were given as seen in the figure below.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure
        class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/aQ_J9pD4Mc1mLa2hERW8z5cJ4uHcu-irEHCg5w2nvZJUp2VV5rW0DFalsjRNSQJlo2tAMzCvvwgQ6nXolSazIys3bd9ZbZCWS41AUOvU4lMu9qzmJbnGmiYlDNtlZpo0p_DQLoXa\"
        alt=\"ROS Kinetic migration poll\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With 269 votes,
        ROS 2 Foxy stood up as the main option for our ROS community with 37% of responses.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ROS
        2 represents a no legacy carryover approach; all the design criteria have
        been revisited to get the best possible experience. Take for example communications,
        in ROS 2 we no longer have a hub\/spoke design. Instead, ROS 2 has essentially
        a peer-to-peer design by default, where each component can discover peers
        and talk directly to them. ROS 2 includes pluggable middleware, DDS, with
        different vendors offering different capabilities, to handle the inter-robot
        communications. This new middleware enables on-the-wire security, such as
        including authentication before joining the ROS graph or enforcing permissions.
        Undoubtedly, ROS 2 comes with a learning curve. Here you can find a complete
        <a href=\"https:\/\/index.ros.org\/doc\/ros2\/Contributing\/Migration-Guide\/\">migration
        guide<\/a> for ROS 2 Foxy.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a combined 46,6%,
        ROS 1 is still a desirable option for the community. The migration to Melodic
        is easier, as it still supports Python 2. For those of you still working with
        Kinetic who wish to upgrade to a newer version of ROS 1, you can find guides
        for <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.ros.org\/melodic\/Migration\">Melodic <\/a>and
        <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.ros.org\/noetic\/Migration\">Noetic <\/a>on the ROS
        1 wiki.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, staying in Kinetic is still an option
        for our voters. With a significant 16,4%, we see that people want to remain
        in this EOL distribution. Let\u2019s explore why.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What
        is your ROS Kinetic migration challenge?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The second
        question aims to explore the main challenges for migrating. Like before, four
        options were given as seen in the figure below, with 179 people in this poll.
        Software availability\/compatibility were acknowledged as the main challenge
        for developers with 35,4% of responses.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img
        src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/8HOr9ctuQ_vor0GMYAqmQXQHmnwRbxfNzFX6VIIpU_OPdvQsmBcpWvxTNME4DZ1ko1EdNRdViCFXrvbjbD6HMI5RntUtCbI0-vSiC8b9Bb_UWaVZWczHhcgms2Drc6pX249ZrlsP\"
        alt=\"ROS Kinetic migration challenges poll\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of
        the challenges when moving to different distributions is software availability.
        In ROS, some of the ROS packages that you used in one distribution (e.g. Kinetic)
        might not be supported in newer distributions of ROS (e.g. Foxy). In the same
        way, some APIs from your current ROS environment might depend on specific
        versions of the applications and libraries of Ubuntu Xenial. For example,
        Python 2.7 is no longer supported in ROS 1 Noetic nor ROS 2 Foxy.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other
        technical challenges (such as Ubuntu migration) and the challenges of migrating
        remotely also contributed to the difficulty of the task. Take for instance
        those deploying ROS robots in the field. Their users are already employing
        the robots, perhaps in critical operations. Collecting all the deployed units
        represents a challenge for companies. It requires planning internally and
        with their end user. Migration also brings additional expenses, including
        for the users due to robots\u2019 downtime operation.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally,
        24,2% voted to stay in Kinetic. Let\u2019s discuss the implications next.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Unsupported,
        your robot is at risk.&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Working with an EOL distribution
        is not safe. Have a look at our latest webinar about the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brighttalk.com\/webcast\/6793\/482788\/ros-kinetic-end-of-life\">risk
        of staying on ROS Kinetic<\/a>. In a nutshell, you are putting your device
        and user at risk by not receiving security updates for your OS and ROS environment.
        As with any system, robotic security is not just about the platform itself,
        but the weakest link in the digital ecosystem where the robot resides. Therefore,
        robotics companies need to develop security mechanisms for securing their
        products from malicious actors and understand the risk that they bring and
        are exposed to in any network.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Software updates for
        security maintenance represent the minimum requirement for reducing vulnerabilities.
        If a robot software in a manufacturing line or retail is not maintained, sooner
        or later attackers may gain a foothold on it and possibly use it to gain access
        to the device itself, and potentially to other corporate assets. Therefore,
        security maintenance is included in all cybersecurity frameworks such as the
        Center for Internet Security (CIS) top 20 or National Institute of Standards
        and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, and its application in robotics
        is as equally valid as any other computational system.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>ROS
        ESM<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, we recommend companies migrate to a supported
        ROS distribution. But we understand the challenges of migration and conducting
        and maintaining a security maintenance infrastructure for robotic companies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore,
        to support the deployment and security of ROS robots deployed on the field,
        Canonical designed the <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/robotics\/ros-esm\">Robot
        Operating System Extended Security Maintenance (ROS ESM)<\/a> as the foundation
        for security compliance in different industries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Delivered
        in <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/hardened-ros-with-10-year-security-from-open-robotics-and-canonical\">partnership
        with Open Robotics<\/a>, ROS ESM provides enterprise support for ROS and the
        Ubuntu OS. Through ROS ESM robots will receive backported security updates
        that have been tested and curated guaranteeing system stability. We aim to
        help ROS developers deploy more secure devices by easing security maintenance
        with ROS ESM.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> <a class=\"p-button--small p-button--positive\"

        Anywhere allows you to use Amazon Web Services&#8217; container service outside
        of the AWS cloud, and Canonical is proud to be a launch partner for this service.
        Using Ubuntu as the base OS for your ECS clusters on-prem or elsewhere will
        allow you to benefit from Ubuntu&#8217;s world-leading hardware support, professional
        services, and vast ecosystem, in turn allowing your ECS clusters to run with
        optimal performance everywhere you need it.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this example,
        we will demonstrate running the ECS Anywhere agent on an Ubuntu server on-prem.
        We will use Multipass to simulate an on-prem server but you can run these
        instructions on any supported release of Ubuntu, whether in your data center
        or in any public cloud.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Prerequisites<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To follow
        along, you will need to have the <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/cli\/latest\/userguide\/install-cliv2.html\">AWS
        CLI utility<\/a> installed and configured on your machine. We will use <a
        href=\"https:\/\/multipass.run\/\">Multipass<\/a> to create an Ubuntu VM but
        you can run these instructions directly on your Ubuntu servers where you want
        to run the ECS Anywhere workloads. You can use Multipass to easily and quickly
        get official Ubuntu VMs for Windows, macOS, and Linux.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To
        install Multipass on Linux:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo
        snap install multipass<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Set Launch variables<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On
        your Linux machine where you have the AWS CLI installed (not necessarily the
        machine where you will run the ECS Anywhere workloads), set the environment
        variables:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1\nROLE_NAME=ecsMithrilRole\nCLUSTER_NAME=test-ecs-anywhere\nSERVICE_NAME=test-ecs-anywhere-svc<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Create
        the IAM role<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Create a file called ssm-trust-policy.json with
        the following contents:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>{\n  \"Version\":
        \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": {\n    \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n    \"Principal\":

        create the role and verify:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>aws

        Verify\naws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name $ROLE_NAME<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Create
        ECS Anywhere Cluster<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Create the ECS Anywhere cluster and activation
        key:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>aws ecs create-cluster

        | tee ssm-activation.json<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Launch an Ubuntu VM with
        Multipass (optional)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We will now create an Ubuntu 20.04 VM
        with Multipass. This step is not required if you already have an Ubuntu server
        where you want to run the ECS Anywhere workloads. This could be any Ubuntu
        VM or bare metal machine in your data center, or even an Ubuntu instance running
        in a different public cloud. In that case, just run these commands on that
        server directly:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>multipass
        launch focal -n ecs-anywhere-ubuntu<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Install ECS
        Anywhere agent and required software on Ubuntu<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we install
        the ECS Anywhere agent on the Ubuntu server. Make sure to replace the ACTIVATION_ID
        and ACTIVATION_CODE with the ones generated in the previous steps:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-code\"><code># Run all commands on the Ubuntu system where

        the installation completes, exit the SSH session and go back to your machine
        where you ran the original AWS CLI commands. Verify that the instances are
        connected and running:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>aws

        is a YouTube channel that was once the place for Ubuntu Test Days, Docs days,
        and other community-related events. With the <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/reintroducing-the-community-team\">(re)introduction
        of a community team<\/a> at Canonical, Community Representative <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/communiteatime\">Monica
        (@madhens)<\/a>, completed a retrospective report titled \u2018The state of
        the Ubuntu community\u2019. In the report (coming soon) numerous things were
        identified that led to the decline of the Ubuntu community, and of course,
        numerous things that the community enjoyed but were hurt but disappeared as
        the community fizzled.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>What we want to achieve<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>In
        an attempt to give community projects and contributors a platform to talk
        about their work and interact with the community, we are restarting UbuntuOnAir
        as a community project. While we are Canonical employees, and the first x
        streams will predominantly feature Canonical people, UbuntuOnAir will only
        feature people with Ubuntu contributor hats on.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For
        newbies, we want UbuntuOnAir to be a way to find out what\u2019s going on
        and how it\u2019s going. If one person interested in Ubuntu sees the channels,
        watches a stream, clicks a link, and starts contributing, we\u2019ve succeeded.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Get
        involved<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously what\u2019s there so far is pretty green
        and relatively little. We\u2019re still in the getting start-up phase. But,
        there is always something you can do to help. The easiest thing is to come
        along to the streams that do exist and participate in the chat. If you have
        any thoughts or ideas about things we could stream about or ways you\u2019d
        like to contribute you can head over to discourse and <a href=\"https:\/\/discourse.ubuntu.com\/c\/community\/78\">let
        us know<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you\u2019re interested in learning
        more you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.communi-tea.io\/ubuntu\/ubuntu_on_air\/2021\/05\/26\/twitchy-tahr.html\">read
        Monica&#8217;s summary<\/a> over on her blog, or this article itself was condensed
        down from <a href=\"https:\/\/musing-press.com\/ubuntuonair\/\">my personal
        blog <\/a>that goes deeper into the why, the how, and our plans for the future.

        25, 2021<\/strong>: Together with Oracle, Canonical announces an optimised
        Ubuntu image for the launch of&nbsp; Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Ampere
        A1 Compute. Oracle Cloud customers will benefit from running Ubuntu, the most
        popular cloud operating system, on a secure, scalable, and highly cost-effective
        infrastructure. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cUbuntu on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
        Ampere A1 Compute provides a high performing and cost-effective solution for
        all types of workloads. Ubuntu gives developers a highly optimized cloud operating
        system and kernel with excellent boot speed, strong security, and stellar
        stability,\u201d said Matt Leonard, vice president, product management, Oracle
        Cloud Infrastructure.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAmpere and Canonical
        are partnering to bring cloud native solutions to the market. Together, we
        have optimized everything from the Ubuntu OS to OpenStack to K8s to Anbox
        Cloud for Ampere\u00ae Altra\u00ae. We are excited to see all of these technologies
        available to the market on the OCI Ampere A1 platform, which is available
        on the OCI Free Tier today,\u201d&nbsp; said Jeff Wittich, Chief Product Officer
        at Ampere Computing.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same secure Ubuntu, now with Oracle
        Cloud optimized kernel and configurations. Combining the benefits of Ubuntu
        with the performance of Oracle&#8217;s new offering, enterprises can run traditional
        workloads in a cost optimised fashion. The ARM-based platform is also particularly
        suited for new use cases, such as Anbox Cloud, which allows organisations
        to run Android in the cloud at scale and securely. For this reason, Umony
        a supplier of compliance communication solutions for regulated markets will
        be integrating Anbox Cloud with the new Ampere A1 Compute instances. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe
        needed a solution to run Android in the Cloud at scale &#8211; Anbox Cloud
        by Canonical let us do this. It gives us a solid foundation to build our compliance-focused
        products, and with the new OCI Ampere A1 Compute instances, we can significantly
        decrease our per Android instance cost as it can provide the needed density
        of running a huge number of Android devices per instance,\u201d said Dean
        Elwood, CEO at<a href=\"https:\/\/umony.com\/\"> Umony<\/a>&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a
        href=\"https:\/\/anbox-cloud.io\/\">Anbox Cloud<\/a>, Canonical&#8217;s solution
        to run Android at high scale on any cloud, benefits from the performance and
        density that OCI Ampere A1 Compute can provide. Running hundreds of Android
        containers for automation use cases becomes simple while providing great economics.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ubuntu
        on OCI Ampere A1 is available as a platform image in the OCI console now.

        our mission to make free software available to the most;<\/li><li>Ability,
        a wide range of open source applications and the tooling to <a href=\"https:\/\/juju.is\/\">operate<\/a>;<\/li><li>Opportunity,
        with the world moving to cloud-native software, whether it\u2019s on public,
        private, or <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/tag\/micro-cloud\">micro
        clouds<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h1>Ubuntu, the most popular base layer<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>It
        would be fair to ask why, suddenly, we care so much about container images.
        After all, we only published <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/security\/docker-images\">our
        first OCIs<\/a> as an organisation last year <em>(*although <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/hub.docker.com\/u\/jujusolutions\"><em>some
        teams<\/em><\/a><em> at Canonical have been building Docker images for quite
        some time)<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is even more surprising as demand is there.
        Ubuntu is <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.docker.com\/search?q=&amp;type=image\">the
        most popular base<\/a> layer on Docker Hub, the preferred choice for developers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure
        class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/WncExfxOuOznMC6of8eUYj02IegE157ZOqtyAcWbZa0_Ek2xGj7EVJTsPpjfd4RbZkI76AE9TkSIWf3CxWKh4sKV0GYE-JTbDNGboz04AMMUZtOqcA4JexZOaN6jBou5dhuIwUyQ\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Being the base layer for billions of containerised
        applications gives us a considerable responsibility that we take very seriously.
        As we\u2019ve been looking at the landscape of container images, we found
        <a href=\"https:\/\/snyk.io\/blog\/10-docker-image-security-best-practices\/\">publications<\/a>
        showing that most of them had known vulnerabilities with very long times to
        remediation. Consequently, adoption of open-source software could be limited
        and generate additional costs as enterprises need to build internal pipelines
        to cover their app dependencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the near future, we plan
        to offer enterprises the same security and stability they already have with
        Ubuntu Pro and ESM (Extended Security Maintenance) programs on containers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Hardened-er,
        better, faster, simpler<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>The state of open source security
        in the cloud-native world is far from perfect, and it often requires engaging
        with multiple companies or organisations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the years went
        by, we found ourselves in a trusted Open Source partner position for many
        projects. It definitely isn\u2019t a surprise, as our Security expertise grew
        over the years from the 24\/7 commercial support included in Ubuntu Advantage,
        the Extended Security Maintenance (ESM) <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/esm\">for
        Ubuntu and other major software components<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/public-cloud\">Ubuntu
        Pro<\/a> on cloud platforms and now on-prem, and, most recently, the same
        commitments for an expanding Universe of Applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our
        first response in the container world has been with the \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/security\/docker-images\">LTS
        Docker Image Portfolio<\/a>,\u201d a curated set of secure container application
        images hardened by Canonical and available with a long-term security commitment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These
        hardened application OCIs have been made available, for the first time, on
        Docker Hub, free to use by the developer community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our next
        steps are extending the portfolio and building a sense of \u201chardened-er,
        better, faster, simpler\u201d container images; for anyone to use with simplicity
        during the development and serenity while in production.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>\u201cSimpler
        open source application ops on K8s\u201d with Mark Shuttleworth<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>For
        our talk at DockerCon, we long brainstormed the most helpful content for you,
        the audience. We quickly eliminated ideas around our LTS Docker images; although
        helpful, developers know the value so there\u2019s not much to be said. We
        also wandered around a \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/canonical\/pebble\">Pebble<\/a>\u201d
        introduction, but that would have been too big a step in the time we have
        together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at the results from our <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/canonical-at-kubecon-europe-virtual-2020\">Kubecon<\/a>

        MUCH simpler to Docker developers would be the most practical we could do.

        is the latest release of Ubuntu and comes at the mid-point between the most
        recent Long Term Supported (LTS) release of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and the forthcoming
        22.04 LTS release due in April 2022. This provides a good opportunity to take
        stock of some of the latest security features delivered in this release, on
        the road to 22.04 LTS. Ubuntu 21.04 brings with it a vast amount of improvements
        and features across a wide variety of packages. In this blog post, we will
        take a look at those features and improvements that add to the overall security
        of a Ubuntu system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>One GRUB for Ubuntu<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting
        from the bottom-up, one of the most fundamental components in Ubuntu is the
        GRUB2 boot-loader. In light of the recent additional <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/grub2-secure-boot-bypass-2021\">GRUB2<\/a>
        secure-boot bypass vulnerabilities, the Ubuntu Foundations team considered
        options to make Ubuntu more secure by enabling easier grub updates. The outcome
        was to change the way GRUB2 is shipped in Ubuntu. In general Ubuntu releases
        would ship with a fixed version of GRUB2 (and many other packages) at release
        time and so when it came time to fix security issues, patches would have to
        be backported to an aging codebase. This brings numerous technical challenges,
        so to alleviate these, a single GRUB2 package will now be shipped across all
        supported Ubuntu releases, with 21.04 being the initial release to support
        this feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Firmware updates and fwupd<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since
        the advent of the <a href=\"https:\/\/fwupd.org\/\">Linux Vendor Firmware
        Service (LVFS)<\/a> and the associated fwupd daemon, Ubuntu has supported
        easy installation of firmware updates, including both BIOS and peripheral
        devices. These firmware updates often contain crucial fixes for security flaws
        and so ensuring devices have the latest firmware updates is an integral step
        for good security. Ubuntu 21.04 ships with the latest fwupd release 1.5.8
        which includes support for SBAT metadata required for the latest UEFI Secure
        Boot improvements, as well as support for enabling firmware updates for many
        more classes of devices including the Pinebook Pro and System76 keyboards
        just to name a few.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The 5.11 Linux kernel security changes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        Linux kernel is at the heart of all running Ubuntu systems. The kernel in
        Ubuntu 21.04 is based off the upstream 5.11 kernel, which brings with it a
        number of improvements since the 5.8 kernel which is used in Ubuntu 20.10.
        These include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>CAP_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In modern
        datacenters, the ability to migrate workloads across machines is becoming
        increasingly important to enable optimal performance and availability. One
        mechanism used to support this is called checkpoint\/restore &#8211; this
        allows the ability to snapshot one or more processes on a system and capture
        their entire state, then move this across to another system and seamlessly
        restart those processes. In the past, this has required a supervisor process
        to have complete system administrator privileges (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) on a machine
        just to perform this one function, granting excessive permissions when not
        required. To allow a more fine-grained approach, a new capability CAP_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE
        has been introduced &#8211; this allows a supervisor process to perform the
        required checkpoint\/restore operations with just the subset of permissions
        required, and so aids in the implementation of a principle-of-least-privilege
        system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>RISC-V stack protector<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>RISC-V is an
        open standard instruction set architecture designed around the reduced instruction
        set principles, and has been supported as a technology preview since Ubuntu
        20.04 LTS. Since the 5.9 release of the Linux kernel, the RISC-V architecture
        has gained support for implementing stack protection, which is a hardening
        feature to detect and prevent kernel stack buffer overflows which can be used
        to compromise the security of a system. This brings this relatively young
        architecture to closer feature parity with the more mature architectures like
        amd64 which have supported kernel stack protection since Ubuntu 9.04, over
        11 years ago.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Static calls for improved Spectre mitigation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/meltdown-spectre-and-ubuntu-what-you-need-to-know\">Spectre<\/a>
        vulnerabilities were the first of many recently discovered speculative-execution
        vulnerabilities, which exploited various microarchitectural features of the
        underlying processor hardware to leak information across security boundaries.
        The discovery of these vulnerabilities led to the implementation of many novel
        mitigation techniques, however these came with various performance impacts
        which would lead to users potentially making a poor choice between security
        and performance. Over time, the performance impact from these mitigations
        have been improved &#8211; in particular the implementation of static calls
        within the 5.10 kernel has seen a noticeable improvement in the perf subsystem
        and others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>ARM64 Memory Tagging<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Memory corruption
        remains one of the chief sources of vulnerabilities within the Linux kernel.
        Whilst various software-based mechanisms (such as the aforementioned stack
        protector) have been developed to try and mitigate against these, a number
        of hardware based approaches have also been in the works. One such approach
        is memory tagging, as supported by the Armv8.5 Memory Tagging Extension. This
        aims to prevent memory safety issues by tagging memory addresses with a key
        that cannot easily be forged and so preventing common memory safety attacks
        such as buffer overflows. The ARM64 architecture in Ubuntu 21.04 now provides
        support for userspace processes to enable the use of memory tagging for certain
        memory regions, and so provides a path to enabling this protection more holistically
        in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Intel SGX&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Trusted computing
        relies on performing computations that cannot be tampered with or altered.
        Intel Software Guard eXtensions (SGX) provide the ability to create a separate
        enclave which can be used to perform trusted operations &#8211; where neither
        the code nor data can be accessed from untrusted components. Support for the
        use of SGX is present in Ubuntu 21.04 whilst hardware support for this feature
        has been present in various Intel processors on the desktop in recent years
        and the upcoming Xeon \u201cIce Lake\u201d processors will provide SGX for
        server platforms as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Userspace Security Improvements<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With
        each new Ubuntu release, there is the opportunity to refresh the range of
        software packages provided within the Ubuntu archive to the latest release.
        Some notable security relevant software packages updated for Ubuntu 21.04
        include OpenSSH and Libseccomp. OpenSSH has been updated to the 8.4 release,
        which provides improved support for FIDO\/U2F hardware tokens. This includes
        supporting tokens that require a PIN for each use, plus better support when
        using multiple tokens at the same time. This allows users to enable remote
        access with increased assurance that it cannot be abused by unauthorised attackers.
        Libseccomp on the other hand is a more low-level component, but has been crucial
        in the implementation of sandboxing technologies which allows applications
        to limit their own impact in the event of compromise. Upgrading to the 2.5.1
        release of Libseccomp brings support for userspace notifications (used by
        container managers like LXD) and improved performance when adding new rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally,
        another important and long-awaited change is the introduction of <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/private-home-directories-for-ubuntu-21-04\">private
        home directories by default in Ubuntu 21.04<\/a>. This ensures that new users
        files will only be accessible to that user and not other local users on the
        same system, recognising the shift away from shared desktop computing to the
        more hostile use-cases of cloud or IoT.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>In

        the end. Two partners, two allies, two distributions that supported millions
        of innovators have reached their end-of-life (EOL). April will be remembered
        as the month where ROS Kinetic and Ubuntu Xenial reached EOL. ROS Kinetic
        is one of the most used, widely deployed and extensively contributed ROS distributions
        (1st with 1233 repos in ros\/rosdistro). Released in 2016, it supported newer
        related components, notably Gazebo 7 and OpenCV 3, and this month has reached
        its end.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the end has also brought opportunities,
        and today we will chat about them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>ROS migration&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With
        ROS Kinetic and Ubuntu Xenial reaching EOL, you will stop receiving security
        updates &#8211; for this reason, we do not recommend staying in an unsupported
        distribution of Ubuntu or ROS. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We encourage you to <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/ros-kinetic-and-ubuntu-16-04-eol-how-to-mitigate-the-impact\">explore
        migration options<\/a> to keep your robot compliant with security maintenance
        frameworks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Migration leads to new opportunities, such as moving
        to ROS 2 and starting to learn about DDS. Some people might find this troublesome,
        but it shouldn&#8217;t be. Learning about DDS will definitely help you, as
        more technologies are using it for obtaining reliable pub\/sub frameworks.

        this &#8211; can you blame us? It&#8217;s simply a masterpiece of engineering.
        In April humanity&#8217;s first spatial drone made its first flight on mars.
        <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/feature\/jpl\/seeing-nasa-s-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-fly-in-3d\">Ingenuity
        autonomously rose<\/a> to a height of 5m before speeding off laterally for
        50m &#8211; half the length of a football field at over 2,500 revolutions
        per minute. Ingenuity then came back to its take-off spot, for a total flight
        time of 80 seconds.\u00a0<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has completed 3 flights in
        total, in our pursuit to explore the flight dynamics in Mars. Getting airborne
        on the planet is not easy. The atmosphere is thin, just 1% of our density
        on Earth. This gives the blades on a rotorcraft very little to bite into to
        gain lift.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/lXy5f6X9z2UNMc1e_A8JD_4Ex7DUiRvlN3kuWEDndRV1OaYSQMFBQlKaoAOSEx05ApaGqf-CZbxorOeEg_A21CcHnSB5Jtva6ewTJ2N3NvF7Fy2V9VEhUrkQ9NoqvjmOyUbV-yku\"

        Ingenuity at Nasa&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We

        when you thought that robotics arm applications couldn&#8217;t surprise you
        anymore, Adidas opened the door to more automation. Robotic arms can be used
        in pick and place functions, assembly operations, arc welding, handling machine
        tools and more. We have adopted them to accelerate production, and today they
        are doing incredible things for footwear. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The STRUNG robot
        is an industry-first textile and creation process that allows Adidas to input
        athlete data into the precision placement of each thread to make the perfect
        shoe for athletes. The robot places each thread into a single composite with
        specific performance zones and properties. The result is a lightweight upper

        more active lifestyle. Yes, most of them are expensive and require big equipment
        that cannot be used outside medical centres, but this is slowly changing.
        <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take for instance <a href=\"https:\/\/spectrum.ieee.org\/automaton\/robotics\/robotics-hardware\/video-friday-good-robots-for-bad-knees\">Ascend
        <\/a>a smart knee orthosis designed to improve mobility and relieve knee pain.
        This customisable, lightweight, and comfortable robot reduces burden on the
        knee and intuitively adjusts support as needed. Designed for people suffering
        from osteoarthritis, knee instability, and\/or weak quadriceps, Ascend is
        one of those wearables that can be used in our day to day. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        alt=\"Ascend knee wearable \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But we are not stopping
        there. Researchers working at the University of Waterloo in Canada are using
        artificial intelligence and wearable cameras, now aiming to help robotic exoskeletons
        walk by themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big downside of wearables that support
        large parts of our body is that they rely on manual controls to switch from
        one mode of locomotion to another. Therefore shifting from standing to walking,
        or walking on the ground to walking up or downstairs, need to be done manually.
        This is no longer functional if every time you switch the way you want to
        move you need to use a joystick or smartphone app. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        <a href=\"https:\/\/ieee-dataport.org\/open-access\/exonet-database-wearable-camera-images-human-locomotion-environments\">ExoNet
        project<\/a>, is the first open-source database of high-resolution wearable
        camera images of human locomotion scenarios. ExoNet contains over 5.6 million
        RGB images of indoor and outdoor real-world walking environments, which were
        collected using a lightweight wearable camera system throughout the summer,
        autumn, and winter seasons. Approximately 923,000 images in ExoNet were human-annotated
        using a 12-class hierarchical labelling architecture. The Waterloo team used
        this data to train deep-learning algorithms to recognise different walking
        environments with 73% accuracy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img

        alt=\"ExoNet automation \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Through this, the study
        aims to eliminate the manual control of wearables by providing systems with
        the intelligence needed to detect and fit automatically the mode of locomotion
        needed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>microROS and Raspberry Pi Pico<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A
        combination from heaven. MicroROS allows you to control microcontrollers using
        the same ROS framework. This enables innovators to easily interconnect microcontrollers
        with their ROS 2 applications and with these different sensors and actuators.

        ESM <\/a>provides a single point of contact for all the software in ESM, including

        id=\"t1\">What is ESM?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/security\/esm\">Extended
        Security Maintenance<\/a> (ESM) for Ubuntu underpins ROS ESM and provides
        extended Linux kernel and open source security updates for the Ubuntu base
        OS. This includes key infrastructure components, like Ceph, OpenStack and
        Kubernetes, as well as open source applications, like Python 2, OpenCV3, PostgreSQL,
        NGINX, and more. Although not part of ROS, many of these applications are
        commonly bundled with robotics applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"t2\">What
        is ROS ESM?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/robotics\/ros-esm\">ROS
        ESM<\/a> builds on top of Ubuntu ESM by giving you a hardened and long-term
        supported ROS system.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ROS ESM is part of <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/support\">Ubuntu
        Advantage<\/a>, Canonical\u2019s service package for Ubuntu. This package
        includes 10 years of critical security updates and fixes for CVEs in addition
        to support.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"t3\">What is included in ROS ESM?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ROS
        ESM includes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Backported security updates for ROS, the
        Ubuntu base OS and scale-out infrastructure.<\/li><li>CVE (Common Vulnerabilities
        and Exposures) fixes for ROS and other important dependencies (e.g. Python2,
        OpenCV3), and the Ubuntu base OS.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Curated ROS packages that
        don\u2019t break API\/ABI<\/li><li>ROS enterprise support&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2
        id=\"t4\">What is ROS enterprise support?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ROS enterprise
        support is a part of ROS ESM. With ROS ESM, customers are provided with long-term
        support for their ROS and Ubuntu environment provided by Canonical and <a
        href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/hardened-ros-with-10-year-security-from-open-robotics-and-canonical\">Open
        Robotics<\/a>. Enterprises can now access a single point of contact to guarantee
        timely and high quality fixes for ROS, ensuring they are not dependent on
        community maintainers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ROS ESM customers can also access
        support to other <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/support\">open source software
        and infrastructure <\/a>through their subscription to Ubuntu Advantage.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2
        id=\"t5\">Is ROS ESM for me?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ROS ESM was designed for
        companies deploying commercial products and services based on ROS. Just like
        the rest of your software, ROS needs regular maintenance as projects scale.
        ROS ESM provides you with continuous maintenance of your ROS environment through
        security updates, CVE and critical bug fixes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether your
        ROS distribution is reaching its end of life, or you are not receiving the
        tailored security updates and fixes your system or customer requires, ROS
        ESM is here to make your work easier. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"t6\">How do
        I get ROS ESM?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about ROS ESM or
        if you want to get ROS ESM, <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/robotics#get-in-touch\">please
        get in touch<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"t7\">Does it offer maintenance
        only for EOL distributions of ROS?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No. ROS ESM also covers
        non-EOL, LTS releases for ROS and Ubuntu. For LTS releases, this will include
        support and security updates for other packages important to ROS (e.g. Python2,
        OpenCV3), plus curated packages that don\u2019t break API\/ABI.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2
        id=\"t8\">What ROS distributions are supported?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We support
        ROS 1 Kinetic, Melodic, Noetic and ROS 2 Foxy.&nbsp; Newer ROS 2 distributions
        can and will be supported.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scope of ROS ESM starts with
        covering the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ros.org\/reps\/rep-0142.html\">REP-142<\/a>
        \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ros.org\/reps\/rep-0142.html#ros-base\">ros_base<\/a>\u2019
        and grows towards \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ros.org\/reps\/rep-0142.html#desktop-variants\">desktop<\/a>\u2019.
        We\u2019re following a process similar to the <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.ubuntu.com\/MainInclusionProcess#Main_Inclusion_requirements\">Ubuntu
        Main Inclusion Process<\/a> to make sure that what we provide can be officially
        maintained, supported and secured.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ROS ESM only applies
        to ROS on Ubuntu.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"t9\">Is ROS ESM a fork?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ROS
        ESM is a fork focused on security and stability. This fork does not have new
        features and diverges from upstream only to meet our customer&#8217;s security
        and stability requirements. Our goal is to keep your deployed robot secure
        for up to a decade with security updates, CVE patches and bug fixes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2
        id=\"t10\">Will ROS fixes be contributed upstream as well?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fixes
        applied to ROS ESM are also proposed upstream for non-EOL distros. As a matter
        of fact, we have already contributed dozens of fixes to Kinetic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2
        id=\"t11\">Does ROS ESM help with security compliance?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With
        ROS deployed as part of so many commercial products and services, it\u2019s
        clear the need for extending the security and support for ROS robots. ROS
        ESM enables compliance with software maintenance requirements for typical
        cybersecurity frameworks.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cisecurity.org\/controls\/cis-controls-list\/\">CIS
        Controls v7.1<\/a>, ESM addresses control 2.2, &#8220;Ensure Software is Supported
        by Vendor&#8221;, control 3.4, &#8220;Deploy automated Operating System Patch
        Management Tools&#8221;, and control 3.5, &#8220;Deploy Automated Software
        Patch Managment Tools.&#8221;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nist.gov\/cyberframework\/framework\">NIST
        Cybersecurity Framework v1.1<\/a>, ESM addresses category PR.MA: &#8220;Maintenance
        and repairs of industrial control and information system components are performed
        consistent with policies and procedures.&#8221;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ubuntu
        has also achieved other <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/security\/certifications\">security
        certifications<\/a>. If you have specific certification requirements for your
        robot, <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/robotics#get-in-touch\">please contact
        us<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"t12\">How long will ROS Kinetic be maintained?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ROS
        Kinetic and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS will still be supported beyond its free initial
        five-year maintenance period in April 2021 for three more years, as it transitions
        to the extended security maintenance phase. Keep receiving security updates
        and CVE fixes for ROS Kinetic with ROS ESM.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"t13\">What
        CVEs will receive patches?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ESM is focused on fixing high and
        critical CVEs. Low and medium updates typically have a mitigation path.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2
        id=\"t14\">Do ROS ESM updates execute automatically on the device?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ROS
        ESM follows the standard Ubuntu update process. ESM does not push updates
        to devices. Rather, subscribers pull them or explicitly enable automatic updates.
        With ROS ESM you can decide whether to consume exclusively security updates
        or both security updates and bug fixes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a ROS ESM user,
        you also get access to <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/security\/livepatch\">Livepatch<\/a>,
        Canonical\u2019s service to apply critical kernel patches without rebooting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2
        id=\"t15\">Which hardware platforms are supported under Ubuntu ESM?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently,
        we are maintaining the Ubuntu Cloud\/Server 64-bit AMD\/Intel binaries. We
        will extend support for other platforms in future updates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2

        Ubuntu<\/a> &#8211; the most popular Linux distribution for OpenStack deployments
        across development and production environments.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wondering
        what makes Ubuntu different? Here are seven reasons you should consider Ubuntu
        when planning your CentOS migration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ubuntu is the leading
        operating system for OpenStack deployments<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the
        <a href=\"https:\/\/www.openstack.org\/analytics\/\">OpenStack User Survey<\/a>
        from 2020, Ubuntu is the most popular operating system (OS) for OpenStack
        deployments. Ubuntu Server powers 40% of OpenStack clouds all over the world.
        So if you are looking for an alternative to CentOS, Ubuntu is the most straightforward
        choice. Ubuntu has been chosen as a platform for OpenStack deployments by
        leading companies in the telco, finance, hardware manufacturing, retail, automotive
        and healthcare sectors. Those include AT&amp;T, BNP Paribas, Cisco, BestBuy,
        Daimler and Spectrum Health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img

        mandatory subscriptions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenStack on Ubuntu is freely available
        to download and use. No mandatory subscriptions or licensing fees are required
        to use OpenStack on Ubuntu. Each Ubuntu instance comes the same, whether an
        optional, <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/openstack\/support\">Ubuntu Advantage
        for Infrastructure (UA-I)<\/a> subscription is attached or not. As a result,
        users benefit from a consistent experience across both development and production
        environments. They can also decide which environments to cover under UA-I
        and which not. UA-I is a per-machine subscription that can be added onto any
        estate to provide access to additional enterprise support and security services
        by <a href=\"https:\/\/canonical.com\">Canonical<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Available
        with enterprise support<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For enterprise customers, Canonical
        provides production-grade commercial support for their OpenStack installations
        on Ubuntu. Three levels of support are available: from security updates only
        through phone and ticket support to <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/openstack\/managed\">fully
        managed services<\/a>. The most comprehensive offering includes cloud monitoring
        and maintenance, incident and problem resolution, software updates, OpenStack
        upgrades and production-grade service level agreements (SLAs). Support is
        charged per node for cost transparency, enabling predictable budgeting for
        organisations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stable, secure, compliant, hardened<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenStack
        on Ubuntu comes with a predictable release cadence and upgrade path. When
        deployed on Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS), users can benefit from five years
        of software and security updates for free. Additional advantages, such as
        <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/security\/esm\">Extended Security Maintenance
        (ESM<\/a>), compliance and hardening programmes are available under the UA-I
        subscription. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/uks-security-branch-says-ubuntu-most-secure-end-user-os\/\">various
        independent rankings<\/a>, Ubuntu is the most secure enterprise Linux distribution,
        providing security out of the box and security by the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div

        version supported<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each upstream OpenStack version comes with
        new features and bug fixes that expand OpenStack capabilities and improve
        its quality. Canonical recognises that and provides full support for every
        version of OpenStack on Ubuntu within two weeks of the upstream release. This
        enables users to get immediate access to the latest updates for their environments
        and stay in sync with upstream. Once a particular OpenStack version reaches
        its end of life (EOL) state, users can easily upgrade to a newer version.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Long-term
        community member<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Canonical has been involved in OpenStack
        development since the early beginnings of the project. Together with other
        leaders, we have been driving the evolution of OpenStack over years, focusing
        on improving its stability and providing an automation framework for its installation
        and operations. Canonical is also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stackalytics.io\/?metric=loc&amp;release=all\">one
        of the top all time contributors to OpenStack<\/a>. As a result, we know OpenStack

        SQL Server<\/a> on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. System administrators can quickly set

        (CLI) using ordinary packaging tools for on-prem deployments or use Ubuntu
        images with the SQL Server pre-installed when deploying on Azure. In addition,
        the SQL Server comes with numerous performance enhancements, including Force
        Unit Access (FUA) support on the XFS filesystem for data durability. Moreover,
        the persistent memory (PMEM) devices can now be used by default without any
        additional configuration. This enables straightforward integration with high-performance
        data storage. Finally, the entire platform is highly available, backed by
        Corosync and Pacemaker, to ensure resilience against failures and increase

        Server Live Installer<\/a> replaced the legacy Debian Installer (DI), providing
        better user experience and access to additional features. Those include the
        ability to auto-update at the installation time, support for SSH sessions,
        installation save and restore capabilities, and more. On the other hand, the
        new installer was missing support for DI preseed scripts. This was making
        some system administrators reluctant to use it. The latest development cycle
        brings the ability to convert DI preseed scripts into the Ubuntu Server Live
        Installer artifacts through the <a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/autoinstall-generator\">autoinstall-generator
        snap<\/a>. This enables system administrators to easily migrate to the new

        stack on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. This concept is similar to
        the Ubuntu HWE kernel stack and aims to provide support for the latest network
        interface cards (NICs) and their features in various components of the advanced
        networking stack. Users will receive updates on a regular basis and will be
        able to benefit from the latest features brought by interim Ubuntu releases
        on their Ubuntu LTS systems. At the same time, the rest of the community will
        benefit from improved stability thanks to fewer potential regressions in the
        update process. The HWE advanced networking stack is available as a personal
        package archive (PPA) and includes rdma-core, dkdk and openvswitch packages.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div

        updates<\/a> that have been available on Ubuntu Desktop through the Update
        Manager since the Ubuntu 13.04 release. Phased updates are a mechanism that
        ensures regressions monitoring and immediate elimination of degraded packages
        when performing system updates. This is achieved by rolling out system updates
        progressively, starting with a small subset of the total user base first and
        steadily scaling up if no issues are discovered. This ensures that all degraded
        package updates are caught and reverted before they are propagated to the
        entire Ubuntu community. APT phased updates increase the overall stability
        level of Ubuntu Server as required by enterprises in their production environments.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div

        Today, Canonical released Ubuntu 21.04 with native Microsoft Active Directory
        integration, Wayland graphics by default, and a Flutter application development
        SDK. Separately, Canonical and Microsoft announced performance optimization
        and joint support for Microsoft SQL Server on Ubuntu.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNative
        Active Directory integration and certified Microsoft SQL Server on Ubuntu
        are top priorities for our enterprise customers.\u201d said Mark Shuttleworth,
        CEO of Canonical. \u201cFor developers and innovators, Ubuntu 21.04 delivers
        Wayland and Flutter for smoother graphics and clean, beautiful, design-led
        cross-platform development.\u201d<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ubuntu has established
        itself as the enterprise engineering platform of choice, from the desktop
        to public cloud and microservices, with a wide range of corporate adopters
        in the finance, automotive, tech and government sectors.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Canonical&#8217;s
        desktop solutions are cost-effective, easy to manage at scale, and simple
        to integrate with enterprise systems. For our 100,000 police officers, Ubuntu
        is user-friendly, reliable, and delivers the requisite privacy and security
        without additional third-party solutions. Ubuntu is our operating system of
        choice&#8221; said Lt-Colonel St\u00e9phane Dumond, French Gendarmerie Nationale.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Microsoft
        SQL Server on Ubuntu delivers an optimised, cost-effective database platform<\/strong><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enterprise
        performance and scalability work from this release have been backported to
        Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS, in support of Microsoft SQL Server. The database management
        system (DBMS) and its command-line interface (CLI) are now available on optimised
        Ubuntu images on Azure, providing a production-grade, highly available database
        platform with ten years of security maintenance. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canonical
        and Microsoft will provide integrated support for Ubuntu with Microsoft SQL
        Server deployed on-prem or through the Azure Marketplace, for mission-critical
        workloads.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The joint solution comes with performance enhancements,
        like Force Unit Access (FUA) on XFS filesystems for data durability. Persistent
        memory (PMEM) offers high-performance data storage without any additional
        configuration. Finally, the entire platform is highly available, backed by
        Corosync and Pacemaker, to ensure resilience.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Active
        Directory: Bridging the gap between system administrators and Linux developers<\/strong><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ubuntu
        machines can join an Active Directory (AD) domain at installation for central
        configuration. AD administrators can now manage Ubuntu workstations, which
        simplifies compliance with company policies.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ubuntu 21.04
        adds the ability to configure system settings from an AD domain controller.
        Using a Group Policy Client, system administrators can specify security policies
        on all connected clients, such as password policies and user access control,
        and Desktop environment settings, such as login screen, background and favourite
        apps.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Flutter and Wayland: a smoother graphics
        experience<\/strong><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ubuntu 21.04 uses Wayland by default,
        a significant leap forward in security. Firefox, OBS Studio and many applications
        built with Electron and Flutter take advantage of Wayland automatically, for
        smoother graphics and better fractional scaling.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flutter
        SDK snap build integration makes it easy to publish your multi-platform Flutter
        app for one-click install by millions of Linux desktop users.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCanonical
        has been a fantastic contributor to Flutter, enabling Linux desktop support
        in Flutter and opening up the opportunity to bring high-quality Flutter apps
        to Linux. We look forward to our continued partnership in making Flutter the
        best choice for app developers, no matter which platform they target,&#8221;
        shared Chris Sells, Product Manager, Flutter. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>New

        Hippo will be released tomorrow and we are excited to show you the new features
        on the way. To celebrate this interim release, we will be hosting a livestream
        indaba. Members of the Ubuntu Desktop development team and a special guest
        from the community will be telling us more about the release and hosting a
        live Q&amp;A.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>When:  <strong>3-4pm UTC on Friday 23rd April<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Where:
        <strong>ubuntuonair.com<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This will take place <strong>3-4pm
        UTC on Friday 23rd April<\/strong>, the day after the official 21.04 release.
        The stream will be hosted on <strong>ubuntuonair.com<\/strong>. We are excited
        to announce that Frederik Feichtmeier from the Yaru team will be participating.
        Yaru is the default theme of Ubuntu, backed by the community. Our speakers
        will be taking questions from the community via live chat so get involved!
        You can post questions in advance <a href=\"https:\/\/discourse.ubuntu.com\/t\/announcing-the-ubuntu-desktop-team-indaba-ama-april-23-2021-3pm-utc\/21591\">here<\/a>
        or tune in and ask them live at <strong>ubuntuonair.com<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If
        this event is successful, we strive to host indabas more regularly, with varying
        topics and different faces from the team as well as the community. Watch this
        space!<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release of Ubuntu Server 21.04 is also coming!

        and running FIPS containers on Ubuntu"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Whether
        running on the public cloud or a private cloud, the use of containers is ingrained
        in today\u2019s devops oriented workflows. Having workloads set up to run
        under the mandated compliance requirements is thus necessary to fully exploit
        the potential of containers. This article focuses on how to build and run
        containers that comply with the <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/fips\">US
        and Canada government FIPS140-2 data protection standard<\/a>. To build Ubuntu
        FIPS140-2 compliant containers you will need the FIPS140-2 certified packages,
        that can be accessed with an <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/pro\">Ubuntu
        Advantage subscription<\/a> or with Ubuntu Pro on <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/aws\/pro\">AWS<\/a>
        or <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/azure\/pro\">Azure<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In
        our example we will demonstrate building a FIPS container on an Ubuntu Pro
        FIPS image. Ubuntu Pro FIPS images are available in <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/marketplace\/search\/results?x=0&amp;y=0&amp;searchTerms=Ubuntu+Pro\">AWS
        Marketplace<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/marketplace\/\">Azure
        Marketplace<\/a>. They are preconfigured and optimized for the US and Canada
        government\u2019s FIPS140-2 data protection standard. They are premium images
        designed by Canonical and provide the Ubuntu Advantage benefits, without the
        need for a subscription. Key features include live kernel patching, enabling
        longer uptimes, and FIPS140-2 certified components to be used for FedRAMP,
        HIPAA, and PCI use cases. Ubuntu Pro is backed by a 10-year maintenance commitment
        by Canonical.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1><strong>FIPS requirements<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Without
        getting into details of FIPS140-2 it is important to underline that a key
        concept of FIPS is that its requirements cover the whole system, from kernel
        to the cryptographic FIPS packages. So when referring to a FIPS container,
        we are referring to a container image that contains the Ubuntu FIPS cryptographic
        packages (e.g., libgcrypt, openssl). As container images use the host kernel,
        that container <em>must run<\/em> under an Ubuntu FIPS enabled kernel in order
        to comply with the FIPS requirements . As a rule of thumb, each Ubuntu FIPS
        container must run under the equivalent Ubuntu version system, with FIPS enabled
        in the kernel.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1><strong>Setting up the system to generate
        a container<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>The system that will generate the FIPS
        container must have an Ubuntu Advantage subscription attached to it, or it
        can be an Ubuntu Pro FIPS image. Ubuntu Pro FIPS images are available in <a
        href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/marketplace\/search\/results?x=0&amp;y=0&amp;searchTerms=Ubuntu+Pro\">AWS
        Marketplace<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/marketplace\/\">Azure
        Marketplace<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep things simple, in this article,
        we will demonstrate how to generate such a container on a public cloud instance
        (AWS or Azure). On AWS EC2 we will be using the \u2018Ubuntu Pro FIPS 18.04
        LTS\u2019 AMI, and on Azure the \u2018Ubuntu Pro FIPS 18.04 LTS\u2019 image.
        The example is very similar when using an Ubuntu system with the Ubuntu Advantage
        subscription attached and FIPS enabled<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Generate the
        container with the necessary FIPS components<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Launch
        an \u2018Ubuntu Pro FIPS 18.04 LTS\u2019 on AWS or Azure. The instances come
        with FIPS enabled out of the box. The launched instance will be used to build
        and run the containers with the FIPS packages. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your FIPS
        worker instance is running, you can generate a FIPS-compliant container as
        follows. You can adjust the list of packages installed, to include only the
        necessary ones for your workload.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>$

        regular engagement days (e.g. Testing and Bug Days), collaborating on a community

        IT, a lot of companies are still quite early in the cloud adoption cycle.
        Nicholas Dimotakis, VP, Worldwide Field Engineering at Canonical explores
        the reasons behind this surprising observation.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/informationweek.com\/cloud\/how-quickly-are-companies-really-adopting-cloud-its-complicated\/a\/d-id\/1340504\">Read

        learn. As any reinforcement learning agent, we get rewarded by the new knowledge
        that we acquire. Likewise, we learn by doing, by rolling up our sleeves and
        getting to work. (Do you want a hands-on book on Reinforcement Learning? Here
        is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.perlego.com\/book\/1365847\/deep-reinforcement-learning-handson-apply-modern-rl-methods-to-practical-problems-of-chatbots-robotics-discrete-optimization-web-automation-and-more-2nd-edition-pdf\">my
        personal favourite<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>March has shown us great examples
        of this. From robots learning to encourage social participation to detect
        serious environmental problems, it was a learning month.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Learning
        to become more human&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a nutshell, human-robot interaction
        is a field that studies how to develop robots that are going to work closely
        with people. This is a fascinating field due to the opportunities it represents.
        For instance, robots can be used in different emotion recognition <a href=\"https:\/\/arxiv.org\/ftp\/arxiv\/papers\/1311\/1311.0352.pdf\">therapies
        with children with autism<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kth.se\/en\/aktuellt\/nyheter\/robots-can-use-eye-contact-to-draw-out-reluctant-participants-in-group-1.1056554\">this
        study from KTH Royal Institute of Technology<\/a> illustrates perfectly what
        robots are able to learn to evoke involvement from people in social contexts.
        Using a <a href=\"https:\/\/furhatrobotics.com\/furhat-robot\/\">Furhat robot<\/a>
        researchers programmed the robot to lead a Swedish word game with participants
        whose proficiency in the Nordic language was varied. The robot\u2019s face
        is optical and is created using a high resolution 180 degrees projector, together
        with face masks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/4fFSZnFkyQnoOR4SbRnMpa4C-XRlo6ZFQaVkAEUByMxt4v9gz7WZGyfBE0bb4FWBA8qCOHKmgJvETFdjuEgP1dmmsECYPkWOrDbdwKcMYiw_IsobFVTb3t_tWPNpTRq85RYERHGT\"
        alt=\"social robot\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers found that by redirecting
        Furhat\u2019s gaze to less proficient players, the robot was capable of eliciting
        involvement from even the most reluctant participants. This might look like
        a small study, but it shows how robots can very dynamically influence how
        people participate, react, and take decisions. Additionally, it contributes
        to the use of robots in educational settings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img

        gaze can modify group dynamics &#8212; what role people take in a situation,&#8221;
        <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2021\/03\/210310122608.htm\">Ronald
        Cumbal, researcher at KTH, says<\/a>. &#8220;Our work builds on that and shows
        further that even when there is an imbalance in skills required for the activity,
        the gaze of a robot can still influence how the participants contribute.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So
        don\u2019t think that robots are just machines doing repetitive tasks. Given
        that we want to incorporate robots into our social world, you will likely
        find more studies that explore robot\u2019s acceptance in different social
        environments.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Learning to explore the universe<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Last
        month we learned about <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/the-state-of-robotics-february-2021\">Perseverance
        and Ingenuity<\/a>. But NASA keeps developing new robots to explore Mars.
        Led by NASA JPL&#8217;s Team CoSTAR, they presented the results of the first
        <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=A8YR2J6KTxU&amp;ab_channel=TeamCoSTAR\">Martian
        Analog testing with autonomous quadruped<\/a>, referred to as Au-Spot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perseverance
        is a wheeled rover. This limits the robot to flat, gently-sloping terrains
        and agglomerate regolith. Rovers cannot tolerate instability and operate within
        a low-risk envelope (i.e., low-incline driving to avoid toppling).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here
        is where legged robots have an advantage. NASA\u2019s \u2018Mars Dog\u2019
        is a four-legged robot capable of navigating through hard-to-access planetary
        surfaces. The robot has unique failure-recovery behaviours, providing a major
        breakthrough in planetary navigation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img

        environmental disruptions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DraBot is an electronics-free soft-robot,
        shaped like a dragonfly that uses air pressure, microarchitectures and self-healing
        hydrogels to watch for changes in pH, temperature and oil.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developed
        by <a href=\"https:\/\/pratt.duke.edu\/about\/news\/drabot\">engineers at
        Duke University<\/a>, DraBot skims across water and reacts to environmental
        conditions.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/tyso2OFLbZsic4ynWdccW6l_rntnrrus0lHoRwbKLEw0RCrmf11UIWM8oq5I91zDD7rnwVFSo0qxaFdA0fMr3iF9FVEC9mcDfPCDqDgy7_b_qVkzz8EhCtLiB2EdDSP_xnceWgtR\"
        alt=\"drabot soft robot \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You might have heard of
        soft robots before. They are a growing trend in the industry due to their
        versatility. For DraBot, the soft principle allows the robot to handle delicate
        objects, such as biological tissues, that metal or ceramic components would
        damage. It also helps robots float or squeezes into tight spaces where rigid
        frames would get stuck. For human interactions, soft robotics is the key in
        physical intelligent developments increasing the safety of corrobots that
        physically interact with people.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DraBot is 2.25 inches
        long with a 1.4-inch wingspan. It was made by pouring silicone into an aluminium
        mold and baking it. The team used <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/topics\/engineering\/soft-lithography#:~:text=Soft%20lithography%20refers%20to%20a,%2C%20molds%2C%20and%20photomasks).\">soft
        lithography<\/a> to create interior channels and connected them with flexible
        silicone tubing.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Movement is created by controlling the
        air pressure in these silicone interior channels. The channels carry air into
        the front wings, where it escapes through a series of holes pointed directly
        into the back wings.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If both back wings are down,
        the airflow is blocked, and DraBot goes nowhere.&nbsp;<\/li><li>If both wings
        are up, the airflow is open, and DraBot goes forward.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        team also designed balloon actuators under each of the back wings close to
        DraBot&#8217;s body. If the balloons are inflated, the wings curl upward.
        By changing which wings are up or down you are now controlling the direction.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally,
        to detect the pH of water, DraBot uses a self-healing hydrogel painted in
        one set of wings. <a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/referenceworkentry\/10.1007%2F978-3-642-27758-0_1230-2\">Hydrogel
        is responsive to changes in the surrounding water&#8217;s pH<\/a>. If the
        water becomes acidic, one side&#8217;s front wing fuses with the back wing.
        This will make the robot spin in a circle, changing its trajectory and signalling
        researchers of this environmental change.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While DraBot
        is a proof-of-principle, it could be the precursor to more soft robots that
        will become environmental sentinels for monitoring a wide range of environmental
        signs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Learning to be a vacuum\u2026<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well,
        it looks like Roomba owners have complained their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/technology-56239454\">devices
        appear &#8220;drunk&#8221; following a software update<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It

        or not charging at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The devices&#8217; maker iRobot has
        acknowledged its update had caused problems for &#8220;a limited number&#8221;
        of its i7 and s9 Roomba models. Adding that a fix would take &#8220;several
        weeks&#8221; to roll out worldwide.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another example
        of why we need to have a plan for updating and rolling back a fleet of robots.

        our series based on the weekly Ubuntu Security Podcast! I am Alex Murray and
        am a Staff Engineer and the Tech Lead for the Ubuntu Security team at Canonical.
        Each month, I cover the most interesting security fixes around Ubuntu, as
        well as an in-depth discussion of the different vulnerabilities that we&#8217;ve
        been addressing. This time we will look into Python updates, have a discussion
        about 16.04 LTS transitioning into extended security maintenance (ESM) in
        April and finally, I will cover some open positions within the team!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Python
        updates<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Seven different CVEs were addressed for the 18.04
        LTS and 20.04 LTS releases. I wanted to talk about this one because it highlights
        all the different versions of Python that are spread across the different
        repositories in Ubuntu. If you are familiar with the Ubuntu repositories,
        you will know we have 2 main sections &#8211; Main and Universe. Main is the
        software that is supported by the security team and other teams at Canonical,
        and Universe is supported by the community.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within Universe,
        we actually have multiple different Python versions across the different Ubuntu
        releases. However, we usually only support a single one in Main, meaning that
        only one version of Python is supported for each release (or in the case of
        Python 2 versus Python 3, we support only one Python 2 and one Python 3 release).
        So for 16.04 LTS and 18.04 LTS, Python 2.7 is in Main. But for later releases
        like 20.04 LTS and 20.10, 2.7 is now in Universe. Whereas say in 16.04 LTS
        we have Python 3.5 in Main, but 3.6 is in Main for 18.04 LTS, and 3.8 is in
        Main for 20.04 LTS and 20.10. We often have the same versions back in the
        older releases but they live in the Universe. This means that it is possible
        to run Python 3.8 in all those older releases, but it&#8217;s in Universe,
        so not officially supported by Canonical.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this
        update, we have rolled in several of those fixes to those versions that are
        in Universe. So if you are running one of those versions that aren&#8217;t
        traditionally supported, you are now a little safer, and you can find details
        of those vulnerabilities either in the <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntusecuritypodcast.org\/episode-108\/\">show
        notes<\/a> or referring back to previous episodes.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>16.04
        LTS to ESM transition<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 16.04 LTS Ubuntu release was released
        back in April of 2016 and was supported by Canonical for five years. This
        month we&#8217;ll be reaching the end of the long-term support period. The
        16.04 LTS release will be transitioning to extended security maintenance (ESM).
        Since the original 12.04 LTS and our first ESM release in 2017, we have been
        supporting a subset of the packages in Main, doing security updates for high
        and critical vulnerabilities for a period of three years once a release transitions
        from LTS to ESM.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we are doing something different
        for 16.04: instead of only supporting just a subset of Main, we will be supporting
        the entirety of Main for high and critical priority CVEs. This means that
        the coverage of what is supported under 16.04 ESM is now expanded compared
        to previous ESM releases.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for people that are running
        16.04 LTS and not in a position yet to upgrade to 18.04 LTS or 20.04 LTS,
        transitioning to ESM is a compelling option. If you want to find out more,
        there&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/ubuntu-16-04-lts-upgrade-vs-esm\">a
        blog post<\/a> written by Lech Sandecki that talks about the trade-offs between
        upgrading from one LTS to another or moving over to ESM, etc. There is also
        <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/engage\/16-04-ESM-webinar\">a webinar<\/a>
        by Lech and Rick Harding from the Ubuntu server team that talks about some
        of those concerns and the kind of things you need to think about if you are
        currently running 16.04 LTS.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a

        is worth noting that not only is ESM available for Ubuntu Advantage customers,
        it is also available for personal use, meaning that anyone can use ESM on
        up to three of their own machines for free &#8211; whilst Ubuntu Members can
        use it on up to 50 machines. And as I said, for those enterprise users with
        bigger needs, it is also available as part of the Ubuntu Advantage program,
        alongside other enterprise perks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>We are hiring<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We

        alt=\"ROS ESM\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Developing robots is not like building
        apps or IoT devices. Robots balance complex features such as scene awareness,
        social intelligence, physical intelligence, communication, dialogue, learning
        from interaction, memory, long-term autonomy, safe failure&#8230; the list
        goes on and on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, robotics startups can take
        years to get to a minimum viable product (MVP). As code develops and packages
        change, the Robot Operating System (ROS) needs to be continuously patched
        and updated. This is time consuming and detracts from your robotics development,
        but running unpatched and unmaintained versions of ROS exposes your robot,
        company and customers to serious risk.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once deployed,
        robots are expected to last years on-site, meaning robotics companies either
        need to factor in OS and software upgrade into their maintenance plans, or
        run on unsupported software. This also affects those developing services for
        robots such as fleet management solutions, navigation or computer vision systems.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As
        a result, whether in production or deployment, robots will inevitably live
        beyond the standard support lifecycle of the software powering it. Whether
        that&#8217;s Ubuntu, ROS or other dependencies (such as Python 2), your system
        will reach its end-of-life, that is, the end of updates, patches and maintenance.
        As an example, <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/ros-kinetic-and-ubuntu-16-04-eol-how-to-mitigate-the-impact\">ROS
        Kinetic and Ubuntu Xenial End-Of-Life<\/a> are upon us.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canonical&#8217;s
        <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/robotics\/ros-esm\">ROS Extended Security
        Maintenance (ESM)<\/a> precisely addresses this issue. As part of <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/legal\/ubuntu-advantage\">Ubuntu
        Advantage<\/a> subscription, and delivered in partnership with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.openrobotics.org\/\">Open
        Robotics<\/a>, ROS ESM gives you a hardened and long-term supported ROS system
        for robots and its applications.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if your ROS distribution
        hasn\u2019t reached its End-Of-Life (EOL), you can count on backports for
        critical security updates and common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) fixes
        for your ROS environment. In addition, by enabling Canonical\u2019s ESM repositories
        you will get trusted and stable binaries for your ROS and Ubuntu base OS distribution.
        Finally, our Ubuntu Advantage Advanced and Standard subscribers can now access
        enterprise support to report ROS bugs to guarantee high quality and timely
        fixes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>How does

        <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/robotics\/ros-esm\">ROS ESM<\/a> builds upon
        the world-class infrastructure used by Canonical to deliver security updates
        for the Ubuntu base OS and critical infrastructure components.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At
        Canonical, we develop security and update personal package archives (PPAs)
        for a number of service packages in the <a href=\"https:\/\/help.ubuntu.com\/community\/Repositories\/Ubuntu\">Ubuntu
        Main Repository and the Ubuntu Universe Repository<\/a>. This includes available
        high and critical CVE fixes and security updates. For instance, at the time
        of writing, we have more than 5,000 CVE fixes for <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/16-04\">Xenial<\/a>
        alone. These fixes reside in our ESM repository and are available to any Ubuntu
        Advantage client through subscription tokens.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With ROS
        ESM, we have also included security and updates PPAs for core ROS packages.
        We will continue to backport critical security updates and bug fixes for ROS,
        for EOL and non-EOL distributions starting with ROS 1 Kinetic.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>The

        upstream ROS components to break backward compatibility &#8211; API breakages,
        much less ABI. To retain stability and provide users with a resilient workspace,
        we patch security flaws, but we also eliminate API\/ABI breakage from updates
        while fixing high and critical fixes and bugs. With ROS ESM, developers get
        curated packages that meet Canonical&#8217;s high standards for stability
        and interoperability.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img

        we will see how the Raspberry Pi Pico can natively speak to a ROS2 graph using
        micro-ROS. We will set up a project in VSCode, compile and upload it to the
        microcontroller. We thus assume that you are somewhat familiar with <a rel=\"noreferrer

        ROS2 on microcontrollers.<\/em><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Raspberry Pi Pico<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        Raspberry Pi Pico, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in
        a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.raspberrypi.org\/blog\/raspberry-pi-silicon-pico-now-on-sale\/\"
        target=\"_blank\">announced in late January 2021<\/a>, is the newest release
        of the Raspberry Pi Foundation which received a ton of attention (a quick
        search on Google and\/or Youtube will convince you). And that&#8217;s for
        a good reason. Compared to its well known predecessors, this new board differs
        in two major ways: it is an <em>in-house<\/em> designed open-hardware <em>microcontroller<\/em>!
        Yes, the chip itself is designed by the Pi&#8217;s engineers and it is fully
        Open-hardware. As usual with the Pi foundation, it is incredibly affordable
        at just 4$.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The details concerning the board itself, the
        differences between microprocessor and microcontroller, the 101 getting started
        or what can the Pi Pico do; all of that is beyond the scope of this post.
        But I strongly encourage you having a look for yourself, whether you are familiar
        with microcontrollers or not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>micro-ROS<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In
        the ROS (1) realm, microcontrollers have always been sort of second class
        citizens. They can&#8217;t interact directly with the ROS graph and developers
        have to rely on libraries such as <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.ros.org\/rosserial\"
        target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new
        tab)\">rosserial<\/a>. But ROS2 is a whole new world and things are changing.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote
        class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&gt; micro-ROS puts ROS 2 onto microcontrollers,
        making them first class participants of the ROS 2 environment.<br><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/micro-ros.github.io\"
        target=\"_blank\">micro-ROS<\/a> project is an effort led by <a rel=\"noreferrer

        and Canonical.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is it? It is essentially a thin
        wrapper (see its <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a

        the DDS protocol. A mouthful. It relies on a &#8216;bridged&#8217; communication
        architecture with a &#8216;broker&#8217; named the &#8216;<a rel=\"noreferrer

        target=\"_blank\">micro-ROS Agent<\/a>&#8216;. The agent is in charge of the
        interfacing between the ROS2 graph and one or several micro-ROS devices.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More

        so now that we have clarified a couple of terms, let us get started, step
        by step, with the official micro-ROS on Raspberry Pi Pico <a rel=\"noreferrer
        noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/micro-ROS\/micro_ros_raspberrypi_pico_sdk\"
        target=\"_blank\">example available on github<\/a>. Note that for this tutorial
        I am running Ubuntu 20.04 with the <a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/code\">VSCode
        snap<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are not running Ubuntu 20.04 yet, you
        could consider using an LXD container. You can refer to our previous post
        \u2018<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\"
        href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/ros-development-with-lxd\" target=\"_blank\">ROS
        Development with LXC<\/a>\u2019 to help you get started setting up the container.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Installing
        dependencies<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s simply start by installing the necessary
        dependencies,<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">sudo apt
        install build-essential cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi libnewlib-arm-none-eabi doxygen
        git python3<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fetching the sources<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We will
        now create a workspace and fetch all the sources,<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">mkdir
        -p ~\/micro_ros_ws\/src<br>cd ~\/micro_ros_ws\/src<br>git clone --recurse-submodules
        https:\/\/github.com\/raspberrypi\/pico-sdk.git<br>git clone https:\/\/github.com\/micro-ROS\/micro_ros_raspberrypi_pico_sdk.git<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        first repository is the Pi Pico SDK provided by the Pi foundation. The second
        contains a precompiled micro-ROS stack together with a hello-world-like example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Setting
        up VSCode<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us now open the example in VSCode and set it
        up. To follow along, you will need two VSCode extensions that are rather common
        for C++ development. These extensions are the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"
        aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/marketplace.visualstudio.com\/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools\"
        target=\"_blank\">C++ extension<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/marketplace.visualstudio.com\/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools\"
        target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new
        tab)\">CMake tools<\/a> for VSCode. After installing them, we will create
        a configuration file for CMake tools and set a variable so that our project
        knows where to find the Pi Pico SDK. To do so, simply type,<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">cd ~\/micro_ros_ws\/src\/micro_ros_raspberrypi_pico_sdk<br>mkdir
        .vscode<br>touch .vscode\/settings.json<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Open the newly
        created file with your favorite editor,<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">vi
        .vscode\/settings.json<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>and add the following,<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"cmake.configureEnvironment\":
        {<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"PICO_SDK_PATH\": \"\/home\/$USER\/micro_ros_ws\/src\/pico-sdk\",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},<br>}<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This
        variable is an environment variable that is only passed to CMake at configuration
        time. See the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"CMake-Tools documentation
        (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/vector-of-bool.github.io\/docs\/vscode-cmake-tools\/settings.html?highlight=configureenvironment\"
        target=\"_blank\">CMake-Tools documentation<\/a> for more info.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let
        us now open the project,<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">code
        .<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Before running the CMake configuration and building
        it, we must select the appropriate &#8216;kit&#8217; (maybe VSCode has already
        asked you to do so). Open the palette (ctrl+shift+p) and search for <code>CMake:
        Scan for Kits<\/code> and then <code>CMake: Select a Kit<\/code> and make
        sure to select the compiler we&#8217;ve installed above, that is <code>GCC
        for arm-non-eabi<\/code>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re all set, let us build
        the example! Open the palette again and hit <code>CMake: Build<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Running
        the example<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wait a minute. What does it do?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Right,
        let&#8217;s break down very briefly what the example does. It sets up a node
        called <code>pico_node<\/code>, then a publisher publishing a <code>std_msgs\/msg\/int32.h<\/code>
        message on the topic <code>pico_publisher<\/code>, a recurring timer and an
        executor to orchestrate everything. Every 0.1 second, the executor spins.
        But only every second, the timer will have the publisher publish a message
        and increase the message data by 1. Simple. So let&#8217;s try it out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Uploading
        to the Pi Pico<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If everything went fine during compilation,
        you should see a new <code>build<\/code> folder in your project view. In this
        folder, you will find the file that we should now upload to the Pi Pico, it
        is named here <code>pico_micro_ros_example.uf2<\/code>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To
        upload it, simply connect the board with a USB cable <strong>while pressing<\/strong>
        the tiny white button labelled <code>BOOTSEL<\/code>. Doing so, the Pi Pico
        will mount similarly to a flash drive allowing us to very easily copy\/paste
        the <code>.uf2<\/code> file. Head to a terminal and type,<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">cp build\/pico_micro_ros_example.uf2 \/media\/$USER\/RPI-RP2<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Once
        the file is copied, the board will automatically reboot and start executing
        the example.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Easy-peasy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Installing the
        micro-ros-agent<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We have seen in the introduction that micro-ROS
        has a bridged communication architecture. We thus have to build that bridge.
        Well, fortunately the development team has built it already and distributes
        it both as a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new
        tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/micro-ros-agent\" target=\"_blank\">Snap<\/a>
        or a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/hub.docker.com\/r\/microros\/micro-ros-agent\"
        target=\"_blank\">Docker image<\/a>. Here we&#8217;ll make use of the former.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If
        you are using Ubuntu 16.04 or later, snap is already pre-installed and ready
        to go. If you are running another OS, you can either <a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/docs\/installing-snap-on-ubuntu\"
        target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new
        tab)\">install snap<\/a> or make use of the Docker image. To install the <code>micro-ros-agent<\/code>
        snap, type,<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">sudo snap
        install micro-ros-agent<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After installing it, and because
        we are using a serial connection, we need to configure a couple of things.
        First we need to enable the <code>hotplug<\/code> feature,<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">sudo snap set core experimental.hotplug=true<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>and
        restart the snap demon so that it takes effect,<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">sudo
        systemctl restart snapd<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After making sure the Pi Pico
        is plugged, execute,<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">$
        snap interface serial-port<br>name:&nbsp; &nbsp; serial-port<br>summary: allows
        accessing a specific serial port<br>plugs:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- micro-ros-agent<br>slots:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-
        snapd:pico (allows accessing a specific serial port)<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>What
        we see here is that the <code>micro-ros-agent<\/code> snap has a serial <code>plug<\/code>
        while a <code>pico<\/code> <code>slot<\/code> magically appeared. As per the
        semantic, we probably should connect them together. To do so run,<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">snap connect micro-ros-agent:serial-port snapd:pico<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We
        are now all set to finally run our example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Actually running
        the example<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Pi Pico plugged through USB, we will
        start the <code>micro-ros-agent<\/code> as follows,<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">micro-ros-agent
        serial --dev \/dev\/ttyACM0 baudrate=115200<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Wait a couple
        seconds for the Pi Pico&#8217;s LED to light up indicating that the main loop
        is running. In case it does not light up after a few long seconds (count up
        to 10 mississippi), you may want to unplug\/replug the board in order to reboot
        it. The initialization procedure of the example lacks a few error checking&#8230;
        Hey, could improving that, be <em>your<\/em> first project?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So
        now the LED should shine a bright green. That&#8217;s cool. Do you know what&#8217;s
        cooler? Running on your host machine,<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">$

        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">$ ros2 node list<br>\/pico_node<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>proves
        that the micro-ROS node running on the Raspberry Pi Pico is visible to ROS2
        on the host machine. Yatta! #VictoryDance<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What\u2019s next?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For
        a long time it wasn&#8217;t convenient to mix microcontrollers and ROS. But
        this is about to seriously change as we&#8217;ve just seen. No doubt that
        both micro-ROS and the Raspberry Pi Pico will bolster great robotics applications
        (and more!).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this tutorial we&#8217;ve reached a great
        starting point with a ROS2-based project ready to spin on the suppa-cool suppa-affordable
        Raspberry Pi Pico.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course this wouldn&#8217;t have been
        possible without the micro-ROS dev team and Cyberbotics engineer Darko Luki\u0107
        (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/lukicdarkoo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer
        noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">@lukicdarkoo<\/a>) who put
        together the initial example we&#8217;ve just used. As often, there are super
        smart people out there making complicated stuff very accessible, shout out
        to them.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m personally going to keep playing with
        micro-ROS on Pi Pico, first because it is fun and second because I have a
        couple of ideas up my sleeves. Make sure to keep an eye on this blog to hear

        know<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a concept, cloud native is a set of technologies and
        practices that allow the creation and maintenance of cloud systems and applications.
        These technologies are built to run well in a cloud environment and serve
        important roles in the cloud ecosystem itself. The use of cloud native technologies
        makes software faster to build, easier to deploy and more reliable to host.
        As a result, engineers have more time to focus on coding and scaling, with
        increased flexibility in the choices they make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cloud native:
        Defined<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The main definition of cloud native comes from the
        CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation). <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"
        (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/cncf\/toc\/blob\/main\/DEFINITION.md\"
        target=\"_blank\">This definition<\/a> is the basis of the majority of cloud
        native references you will find online:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cCloud
        native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications

        the meaning of any of these terms is not clear, you are in the right place!
        Let\u2019s break down some of these key concepts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cloud native:
        Explained<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>What is a public cloud?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A public
        cloud environment is available to every customer over the Internet. Public
        cloud infrastructure is typically managed as a service by a cloud provider
        alongside a diverse portfolio of managed services. The underlying infrastructure
        is shared across customers allowing the loose coupling of hardware and services.
        Companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google provide a wide range of public
        cloud services. Ubuntu is offered on all major public cloud providers &#8211;

        href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/public-cloud\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What
        are loosely coupled systems?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Loosely coupled systems consist
        of independent components that can be connected together without existing
        knowledge of the entire system. This forms the basis of a resilient cloud
        architecture. Each component has a clearly defined function and can fulfil
        its purpose autonomously. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s apply this definition
        to a cloud native platform: a cloud system consists of a mixture of services
        and technologies that can be used together to deliver greater flexibility
        and resilience to the end user. When a cloud provider offers services that
        follow widely used standards and have clear documentation, developers can
        integrate a variety of components together without knowing all implementation
        details of each element. Such systems aim to minimise the risk of interference
        and propagation of faults between its elements . These abilities make a system
        loosely coupled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What is a private cloud?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A
        private cloud is a cloud environment operated for a single organisation. It
        can be deployed on externally or internally-hosted infrastructure and either
        managed in-house or by a third party. Canonical designs, builds, operates
        and supports OpenStack private clouds on Ubuntu &#8211; read more <a rel=\"noreferrer
        noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/openstack\"
        target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although public and private cloud
        infrastructures are important on their own, when combined they can form powerful,
        resilient hybrid or multi-cloud systems. Let&#8217;s learn more!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What
        is a hybrid cloud?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hybrid cloud is a combination of private
        cloud and public cloud. They are deployed across geographical locations and
        network boundaries. Such systems are often managed by a collection of providers
        with a separation of responsibility, allowing an organisation to benefit from
        both types of cloud services. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"

        is everything you need to know about hybrid clouds: how they are built, how
        they work, and what are their benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What is a multi-cloud?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        concept of multi-cloud takes the best from all of the above into one. Multi-cloud
        is the use of multiple cloud environments and service providers, together
        in a mix that best fulfils your engineering and business requirements. A multi-cloud
        environment aims to eliminate the reliance on any single cloud provider. The
        concept of multi-cloud is strongly driven by automation technology that lowers
        the barrier to entry and enables seamless integration across a variety of
        cloud systems and providers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure

        information here, with the advantages and disadvantages of each cloud infrastructure
        explained.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What is a container?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A container
        is an isolated development environment, separate from the underlying infrastructure,
        that runs on top of host operating systems, consisting of an image that defines
        the code and it\u2019s dependencies to run on the container. They are faster
        to spin up than virtual machines and are light-weight, portable, consistent
        and secure. Learn more about Linux containers <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"

        target=\"_blank\">easily spin up a container of your own<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What
        are microservices?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept of microservices is fairly
        broad and has many definitions. In simple terms, microservices are the building
        blocks of a loosely coupled architecture. They represent individual functional
        components of a cloud system. Ideally all microservices can be replicated
        and scaled independently. If you want a productive, open source way to manage
        containers and microservices, <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/kubernetes\/install\"
        target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new
        tab)\">Kubernetes on Ubuntu<\/a> is the way to go!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What is
        a service mesh?<br><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A service mesh is a configurable layer
        of infrastructure that controls the communication between services (usually
        microservices) over a network. To put this into context, imagine you have
        a large, complex cloud architecture with hundreds of microservices to handle.
        You could use a service mesh to manage those services and perform load balancing,
        monitoring, logging, failure recovery and traffic control.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>What is an immutable infrastructure?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Immutable
        infrastructure cannot be changed after being deployed but instead can be rebuilt,
        replaced or destroyed. Using immutable infrastructure ensures that the infrastructure
        is clearly defined, its changes are controlled and it allows for tracking,
        quick reuse and recovery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What are declarative APIs?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Declarative
        APIs allow users to define a desired end state of the system or query outcome.
        They are particularly useful in the orchestration of cloud infrastructure
        and services. This is because using declarative statements allows developers
        to focus on the end result rather than individual steps to achieve it. You
        can read more about declarative DevOps <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"

        Engage<\/a>, Ken VanDine, engineering manager for the Ubuntu desktop,&nbsp;
        made an appearance in the keynote speech to talk about Flutter on Ubuntu.
        Canonical has been working to support Flutter for some time now, bringing
        the SDK to Linux, committing <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/canonical\/ubuntu-desktop-installer\">to
        build a new Ubuntu installer<\/a>, and now, making Flutter the default choice
        for future Canonical mobile and desktop apps. We thought we\u2019d take this
        opportunity to talk about what all this means and why we\u2019re doing it.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<iframe

        and Ubuntu, Ubuntu and Flutter<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in July 2020, we (Canonical
        along with Google\u2019s Flutter people) <a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/blog\/canonical-enables-linux-desktop-app-support-with-flutter?_ga=2.130672647.968809281.1615741199-1046984023.1615195227\">announced
        support for the Flutter app ecosystem<\/a>. This was the first step towards
        Flutter being available for Linux through their alpha release. From there,
        Ubuntu Desktop engineers hit the ground running. You\u2019ll find a full list
        of updates about their work in <a href=\"https:\/\/discourse.ubuntu.com\/search?q=flutter\">the
        team\u2019s weekly discourse posts<\/a> as far back as April. In that list,
        you\u2019ll see that in August of 2020 the team started to discuss building
        a new Ubuntu installer, and Flutter was on the list of possibilities. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well,
        in February 2021, we announced that the installer would be refreshed and it
        was being <a href=\"https:\/\/discourse.ubuntu.com\/t\/refreshing-the-ubuntu-desktop-installer\/20659\">made
        with Flutter<\/a>. This came out of a desire to deliver a refreshed installer
        experience across all of Canonicals products and, after some deliberation,
        Flutter was chosen to be the best option. Now, as of <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/IdrCyS7EF8M?t=205\">Ken\u2019s
        words at Flutter Engage<\/a>, and our involvement in the event, we are making
        sure Flutter is a first-class experience and stays high on our list of platforms
        for consideration when designing future mobile and desktop apps. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure
        class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/admin.insights.ubuntu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/b04f\/flutterinstallerprotos.jpg\"
        alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-101792\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h1>What this means<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Desktop
        app developers have another option for developing applications that they know
        Canonical will continue to support. <\/li><li>Linux developers will be able
        to create apps more easily to work across platforms (desktop, mobile and IoT)
        and operating systems to target Windows and macOS too.\u00a0<\/li><li>The
        desktop team will be working with the Yaru team to ensure Flutter apps are
        <a href=\"https:\/\/pub.dev\/packages\/yaru\">consistent with the design of
        the Ubuntu Desktop<\/a>.<\/li><li>Flutter becomes a first-class citizen for
        snaps and <a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/docs\/flutter-applications\">in
        snapcraft<\/a>.\u00a0<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img
        src=\"https:\/\/admin.insights.ubuntu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/7929\/Screenshot-from-2021-03-15-16-15-27.png\"
        alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-101793\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h1>Why though?&nbsp;<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>There
        are of course numerous options when it comes to developing new apps. Typically,
        for the desktop, you want to optimise your app to \u2018look right\u2019 with
        the underlying OS, for performance, and for proper integration with OS features
        and capabilities. Canonical\u2019s work here meets all of these criteria.
        <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that Canonical is going to be making applications
        for Ubuntu you can count on us putting work into making sure Flutter apps
        \u2018look right\u2019 in the Desktop.\u00a0 Flutter even allows developers
        to use web styles that can \u2018mimic\u2019 the UI of the system. So a Flutter
        app built for Ubuntu can use a collection of widgets modelled purposefully
        after native Ubuntu desktop designs. Flutter has better performance than alternatives
        such as Electron and while it isn\u2019t as performant as native development
        platforms, it does so well that the ability to develop for multiple platforms
        and across operating systems outweighs the difference. And by the same reasoning,
        proper integration will be taken care of. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is all
        well and good but most notably, Flutter is a truly cross-platform tool and
        is open source. If the Linux ecosystem at large picks this up there is a tremendous
        opportunity for massive ecosystem expansion. The vast majority of Flutter\u2019s
        codebase is written in Dart code (using Dart only packages), and just works
        with no modifications necessary across all the platforms. And since the announcement
        in July last year, the number of plugins is slowly but surely increasing for
        Linux. Cross-platform development doesn\u2019t just mean Linux developers
        can write apps for other platforms, it means Flutter developers for any other
        platform can contribute their apps to Linux and expand the Linux app ecosystem
        indefinitely.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is even talk of
        future <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/flutter\/flutter-and-desktop-3a0dd0f8353e\">support
        for Universal Windows Platforms. <\/a>Imagine deploying your Linux app to
