# Percy snapshots

This repo runs visual regression tests via [Percy](https://percy.io/). Three workflows orchestrate it:

- `.github/workflows/percy.yml` — PRs from this repo targeting `main`
- `.github/workflows/percy-fork-pr.yml` — PRs from forks targeting `main` (uses `pull_request_target` with an approval gate)
- `.github/workflows/percy-baseline.yaml` — pushes to `main` (refreshes the baseline that PRs compare against)

The shared gate logic lives in `.github/actions/percy-gate/action.yml`.

## When Percy runs

For PRs (both internal and fork) the `decide` job evaluates, in order:

1. **`run-percy` label present on the PR?** → RUN.
2. **Author is `dependabot[bot]` or `renovate[bot]`?** → SKIP (bots must use the label to opt in).
3. **Diff touches a watched path?** → RUN.
4. **Otherwise** → SKIP.

For pushes to `main` (baseline):

1. **Workflow manually dispatched?** → RUN.
2. **Push diff touches a watched path?** → RUN.
3. **Otherwise** → SKIP.

When the gate decides to skip, the `snapshot` job is skipped but the workflow exits successfully — branch protection (which treats `skipped` as `success` for required checks) is unaffected.

## Watched paths

Defined once in `.github/actions/percy-gate/action.yml`:

- `static/sass/**`
- `static/js/src/**`
- `templates/**`
- `navigation.yaml`
- `secondary-navigation.yaml`
- `snapshots.js`
- `test-links.yaml`
- `package.json`
- `yarn.lock`

To extend the list, edit the `filters:` block in `.github/actions/percy-gate/action.yml`. The change applies to all three workflows automatically.

## How to force a Percy run

### On a PR

Add the `run-percy` label. Adding the label fires a `labeled` event, the gate re-evaluates, and the snapshot job runs.

Reach for this when:

- The PR changes visuals via a path we don't watch (e.g. a Python view that swaps template variables).
- A Renovate or Dependabot PR bumps a visual-affecting dependency (e.g. `vanilla-framework`) and you want a snapshot.
- You want a one-off sanity-check snapshot on any PR.

### On `main` (refresh the baseline manually)

Go to **Actions → Update Percy Baseline → Run workflow**, select `main`, click Run.

Reach for this when:

- A merged PR's change wasn't caught by the path filter and visual drift later surfaces in production.
- You want a fresh baseline before a release.

## Rapid pushes are de-duplicated

PR workflows declare a `concurrency` group with `cancel-in-progress: true`, so pushing several commits in quick succession only completes the latest run — earlier in-flight Percy runs for the same PR are cancelled. The baseline workflow does not cancel itself (every `main` push completes its baseline independently).

## Troubleshooting

**"Percy didn't run on my PR with a CSS change."**
Check the watched-paths list above. If the path is genuinely visual-affecting and not covered, add it to `.github/actions/percy-gate/action.yml`. For a one-off run, add the `run-percy` label.

**"The `Take Percy snapshots` check shows as skipped."**
Expected when the gate decided to skip. The `Decide whether to run Percy` job ran to completion and reported success — branch protection is satisfied.

**"Percy ran on a PR that didn't change visuals."**
Check whether the diff touches any watched path — `package.json` and `yarn.lock` will match any dependency bump. Bots are blocked by default, but a human PR touching these triggers a run.
