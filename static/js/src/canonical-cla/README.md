# Canonical CLA

This is the client side for the Canonical CLA service. It is a React application that uses fetch as a client to communicate with the REST API of the Canonical CLA service. 

The main purpose of this application is to allow individual contributors and organizations to sign the Canonical Contribution License Agreement (CLA) to be able to contribute to Canonical's projects on Launchpad and/or GitHub.
